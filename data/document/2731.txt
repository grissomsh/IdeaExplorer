Transparent storage area mirroring to improve resource utilization and performance
Data centers may have underused storage. At the same time, another storage area may be over-utilized. 
This unbalance cause inefficiencies in terms of I/O operations and network traffic.  
At the Brazilian R&D Center (BRDC) we have different type of storage, like Isilon, VNX and HDFS. There are disk areas that are completely empty but there are other areas that are almost full. Furthermore, some resources are used intensively, creating network bottlenecks. We started thinking of how we could improve our storage hardware utilization and make them more elastic. That is how our idea started.
By creating a mirror of a storage or a SAN using ViPR virtual storage capabilities, we should improve the efficiency (fairness) of resource utilization. We can monitor the network traffic to profile I/O patterns and create micro services to store and retrieve data on the data center. The micro services will redirect data to the correct storage area. Services will also be responsible to keep the mirrors consistent using RAID principles. A first approach to tackle the problem would be using Control Theory (AIMD controller) to guarantee optimal fairness across storage areas.
Our idea should balance the load across different storage areas as well as improving the overall performance of I/O on multi-tenant data-centers.
