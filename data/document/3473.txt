 Integrating Educational Services Lab-as-a-Service with EMC Proven Professional Program

 The idea came up from the experience using EMC proven professional portals and services as well as Education labs (vdc)
 
The idea works as follows : 

-	Integrating Educational Services Lab-as-a-Service with EMC Proven Professional Program through points
-	Each Student that will be certified in any EMC technology/product will have points added to his profile that can be translated to lab access
-	Educational services proven professional profile will integrate with the lab-as-a-service booking profile to provide unified  experience
-	For example: if a student/employee/customer got certified in VNX storage admin, he/she will earn points that can provide him with free access to “VNX booking” in the lab service so that he can book VNX for free or minimum charge

This will promote a comprehensive education experience with our students/customers.
