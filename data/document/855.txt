Facility ticketing system
Enhancing the internal process of handling facility requests among EMC employees
In case of previous facility issues, we have to contact them on-person and wait for response to get issues sorted.
We will be creating a platform/system that uses NT login as credentials.

Each employee will be able to access this tool in case they need to submit a specific ticket regarding their facility issues such as: broken air-condition, cubical issue, etc..

Members of facility team will be taking ownership of each ticket.

After ticket is resolved, facility member will close the ticket and archive it.
-Saving employees time
-Making it fast to resolve facility isues
