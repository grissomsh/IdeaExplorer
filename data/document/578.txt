EMC Movies Corner.
Well, with regards to gender and ethnic diversity, this entertainment activity will definitely group lots of people globally across EMC as they will find a common thing to share together. Not only that, but the movies industry never ends and it always reveals people's culture, thoughts, beliefs, dreams and can always be a great source of inspiration. 

Once, after me and my friends have watched a movie separately, we sat together reflecting on it and this is when the idea came to why not have a movie club in EMC! :)
Movies have always been a universal language that bring us all together and melt boundaries between us all, showing different perspectives for other people's lives. It brings us together and make us understand our cultural difference better by changing the glasses we are using to see the world with.

We can have a movie club where we choose a movie, set a date, group at one place or even watch it separately. After that, We can spend all the time reflecting on that movie, the characters, the thoughts, the ideas and the culture represented in it.

Moreover, we don't have to make it limited to only watching, we can film movies of our great role modes, inspirational people within EMC globe. Every success story can be made as a short movie, to spread all over EMC and to influence and motivate each employee.

Movies can be a great leading means to a great change! So, it would be like an idea worth sharing or spreading in a form of a movie.

What we will call success is when we see different groups sitting together, sharing ideas and listening to each other's arguments, melting the boundaries, tearing down social stigmas and exchanging the thoughts and mindsets :)

If this is implemented successfully, surely our gatherings for reflection won't be limited to movies only, it can extend to books, poems and all common languages across the globe.
