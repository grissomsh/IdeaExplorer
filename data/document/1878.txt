Automatic Scanning Serial Number barcodes using Camera sensor technology
In GPO, Disk drive assembly process is completely a manual process and it cost more money to the company. Improvise the assembly process by automating using latest technologies.
Apex Process Engineering came up with the use of camera sensors, but unable to implement end to end solution using the cameras.
Camera sensors can be used to capture the barcodes instead of manual scan gun. Camera sensors will be mounted in the work table. A new custom developed software will be used to trigger the cameras and capture the barcodes. Once the operator places the drive in the camera fixture, the custom developed software will trigger three different camera sensors and capture the serial number barcodes, validate the serial numbers and submit those serial numbers in a batch to SAP in the background to build genealogy and further processing. The custom software allows to submit the serial numbers in a batch to SAP which will further improvise.
The new camera process was successfully implemented in Apex during May 2015. The new process will save money to the company by reducing man power from 5 to 2 per work table. It eliminates the human error and reduces the cycle time in the drive assembly process.
