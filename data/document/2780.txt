Remote management software.
Durham Data Center Elastic Labs Challenge
- Define group of nodes and configure them based on well defined policies.
- Deployment of images on these nodes.
- Running set of instructions/ script/commands from the central location.
While configuring the libraries in datadomain ddr we need to do lots of manual tests. While thinking of automating these steps i figured out this way and i believe this can become a generic solution going forward.
A remote management software will be created from which all the machines in the lab/cloud can be managed. This will make use of *ssh* as well as a well known open source software called as *Ansible*.

The remote management software will be a daemon which does following tasks, 
- It will maintain in-core information of all the machines it is going to manage.
- Will create all the prerequisites for remote management using ansible, which involves writing the required playbooks, hosts files etc.
- remote management software will maintain the group information, policy information of the tasks to be performed on the group of machines.
- The solution will make management process easier than directly using the ansible and user is not required to understand the format/language which ansible understand.
- A well defined GUI will help user/administrator to easily view all the machines in one screen.
- Administrator will be able to run scripts/commands on remote machines from the GUI very easily.
This solution is generic enough to solve the following problems.
1) The solution will allow to manage all the machines in the lab/cloud remotely.
2) The solution will allow creation of group of machines to manage groups with similar nature.
3) The solutio
