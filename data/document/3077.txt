Improve Service & Reduce Expenses
saving money through process improvement can help EMC to add more money where Clients feel relevant, or even reduce the price they pay for our products and services. in addition will contribute to the work and life balance of all Ops Teams.
I have several years working in operations, and Q after Q I saw a lot of resources used where with a better organization we can add a saving.
define a cut off 5 days before Q end for deal submission. that will cut dramatically all expenses associated with Q end. in addition will bring more effectiveness to the entire organization (sales, forecasting, CRM, inventory, etc.)
EMC will reduce costs, streamline operations, and improve our service to the Clients. in addition all that can be achieved with people working in a stress free environment.
