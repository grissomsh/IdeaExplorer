Application specific security using lockbox

Lockbox is used extensively in SAS UIM and NCM products. Lot of customers are annoyed with the lockbox inaccessible issues in NCM - especially when they dont know which system values its tied to.

Instead of relying on the system stable values, the unique hashing code should rely on the application process information. It can also be computed on a combination of application processes and the application license key.
This way the data is secure and access is confined only to the application and also the application is portable.
