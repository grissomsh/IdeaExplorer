Celebrate employee birthday by planting sampling on EMC Adopted Schools
(100% Employee involvement + Giving back to society + community involvement) 

Came up with this idea , while thinking how to achieve 100% employee involvement towards "GO GREEN" initiative
We can celebrate each employee birthday by dropping nearby EMC adopted school and planting a sampling, along with school kids who are also celebrating birthday on the same day. 
* 100% Employee involvement will be there in this activity 
* We are giving back to the society
* Community involvement 
* Team building 

We can utilize the 3 days , EMC gives us to contribute towards "Giving Back Society"
