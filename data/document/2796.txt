Unique way of logging messages across  CTD products
Idea will improve the supportability of solutions that deploy for multiple CTD products
Improves the trouble shooting 
Helps in preventing/predicting customer issues 
Ease of use 
1 Wrote a script to perform search and build analytic's for NetWorker product messages same thing didn't work for Data Domain or Avamar product because there message structure differ from NetWorker product.
2 Took time to understand data domain log files to debug and obtain a message for particular backup information message which was performed using NetWorker
My solution is develop a binary shipped with the product that will convert log files into a unique format irrespective of the application (It can be even for SQL or Oracle application log if it interacting with CTD product)
Note: format can be decided on discussion
Eg: <Message id>,<Time Stamp>,<daemon or affecting binary name> <error message id> <type> < Message > 
How it meets the criteria of sponsor challenge 
Searching of logs file becomes easier, Single script can suffice the needs
No need understanding message structure of each product because log file contains message in unique format.
Monitoring of application becomes easier like plotting trend of particular message ,analysis of results data mining can be easily done. 
Time of debug the message from different log will be reduced
Customer love to buy different product which has unique way of logging message --Make money
Debugging time reduced will saves money
Enhance customer satisfaction 
Improves productivity
