General Knowledge for new Hires
Diversity and increasing new hires awareness of what EMC do.
my own experience as a new hire and what i usually hear till now from other business units when i speak about what i do. for example most of the Employees within EMC don't know that CST includes different functions , they only know that it is one function only and all Employees within CST do the same thing.
my idea is to design a document or Video (CBT) which should be mandatory for new hires ( like the ISM in some business units). this CBT or Document should be taken after the new hire complete his/her training in order to be aware of what is said.
It is different than what the induction aim for as it would include more details about the Business units, for example : CST Team includes 4 different functions and this CBT/document should include what these function do briefly.
the same for all the business units within EMC.
PS : the induction time is very compressed and loaded with many information which is hard for a new hire to recognize 


increasing new hires awareness which will facilitate their work.
this may bring up ideas for projects which can enhance the day to day work between different business units.
interaction between employees.
