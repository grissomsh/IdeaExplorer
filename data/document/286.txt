Wireless Conference Rooms
IT Contemporary Workplace Challenge: Seamless Access to the wireless network i.e. no SecurID token required when inside EMC and access to applications seamlessly when off network for trusted laptops - Wireless Meeting Rooms being investigated for more convenient access to projectors and displays 

Employees having different laptops and trying to connect to different projectors made  us think of this idea
This idea proposes to get wired projectors out of the conference rooms. Using Bluetooth/ Wifi enabled smart tvs( Chromecast/appletv) in the conference rooms paired with laptops/tablets/mobile devices(smart handheld) we can avoid using projectors. 
Hassle free, wireless meetings
