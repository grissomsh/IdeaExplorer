Usage of POS machines in EMC cafeteria.

Felt this need every time I ran out of money in Sodexho card.
Please ask all food vendors in ICOE EMC cafeteria to keep the card swipe POS machines. This will help employees to swipe their credit debit cards once they run out of money in the Sodexho cards. Right now we need to get cash if the Sodexho card is out of money. Additionally POS machines will not have any when vendor does not have change of bigger denomination currency notes.
I am not sure if other EMC centers do use it, but if they don't then they should also do use it.
