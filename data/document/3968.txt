Travel office

It came to me while planning a trip to the US and having to take too many days off of my own vacation limit to finish up embassy papers and travel documents and such and also because usually big companies can get their employees discounts at major airlines
The company initiates a travel office that can handle any kind of travelling preperations to the employees whether personal or for business, from reserving tickets, hotels, car rental and handling visa acquirment. Also EMC can make a deal with the major Airlines to get for example a set discount Percentage to it's employees.
