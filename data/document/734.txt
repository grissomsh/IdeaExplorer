Integrating ECD Products with EHC To Offer Financial Data Services Solutions
This idea has characteristics mapping to problem areas identified in a number of challenges. For example, the idea proposes to integrate a number of ECD products as components in a typical EHC solution. If feasible, this solution could open up new market opportunities for EMC in the financial data services industry which is a key ask of "Office of CTO Challenge" and "APJ COE Challenge"
When we combined our collective experience in Financial Data Services as well as IT Infrastructure industries, the possibilities offered by EMC Federation products became obvious.
EMC's enterprise hybrid cloud solution can take care of this industry's ever growing data storage needs in the most cost efficient way. The unique enterprise content needs of this industry can be addressed by adding data services of ECD products like InfoArchive and Documentum that can handle any kind of data type. Documentum xPlore can be an excellent choice for the enterprise content search needs of this industry since it is based on a enterprise-grade proven platform like Apache lucene for content indexing, search and hit-highlighting. Syncplicity can be used to make data reception from multiple agents a near real-time possibility in a secure way. We can integrate our Federation Business Data Lake solution for enabling the analytics needs of this industry since the content is a mix of structured, semi-structured and unstructured data.
If it were to be implemented, we are sure to make a huge impact in the industry. Financial data services is a more than $50 billion industry which heavily relies on highly reliable, available, high-performing and real-time computing IT infrastructure. We could be first movers in creating a niche domain worth millions of dollars. If implemented successfully, it could offer us a great success story for the federation strategy.
