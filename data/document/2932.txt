EMC Car boot sale 
This idea is helping improve collaboration / communications and will Bring our Business units, our federation partners and our multiple sites together .
I’ve been to a good few car boot sales and was thinking this would be a great idea for all people and departments to get to know each other and for emc federation partners also to be involved . This would also be in line with our EMC gives back initative.
Emc could hold a car boot sale maybe 4 times a year on Emc’s grounds in which all Emc  employees and Emc federation business partners can Buy and sell things with people across Ireland COE. Sellers could be charged 10 euro for a car stall and people that are entering to buy can pay a 2 euro entry all money raised could go to charity’s like fighting cancer , fighting blindness etc. .
Benefits here would be 1. Good communication between all departments within the Ireland COE and Emc federation business partners and bring our multiple sites together . . 2.  Up to a few charities would benefit from this car boot sale . 3. This idea could be done when business is in downtime . 4. If this idea is deemed possible, it could also be run in all Coe plants .
