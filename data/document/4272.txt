Include customers actively to share their knowledge and open boundaries for more interaction

Since working in support past four years I have interacted with customers having better knowledge about product in terms of usability and configuration . So I think opening the boundaries of JIRA and Salesforce will give us more accountability and higher customer satisfaction.
Transparency for all customer communications will help better accountability and thus result in better TCE
