Smart Identity Card as a Replacement for RSA Hard token
#IT Contemporary Workplace Challenge.
This Solution intends to move out of secure ID tokens by integrating the display  on to employ Identity card. 
My cubicle is next to the Asset Management team . I see many people queue up to collect Hard tokens, which i feel is completely unnecessary !
Every EMC Employ/ contractor are provided with EMC Identity card.  Turn this ID card into a smart card by inserting a  6 to 8 digit display. The display works   in  same manner in which the Secure ID token works. Each Smart ID card number is tagged to employ ID number.
When a manager requests for VPN access to his/her reportee,  Smart ID Card number  which is mapped to the User ID of the employ gets coupled with Secure ID . Employ receives an auto generated email to activate his secure ID by selecting PIN. All this can be  automated and manual interventions can be avoided.

.Avoid Foot Print of RSA Hard Tokens
.100% self service model
.Avoid Asset management FTE cost
.One time cost in integrating Display to the ID card. Probability of loosing an ID card is  negligibly less compared to  loosing RSA secure ID tokens.
. Improves TCE
