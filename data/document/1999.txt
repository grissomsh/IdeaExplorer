KB search enhancement
current algorithm used for "Knowledge Base" search has lots of troubles
as it Shows a huge number of un-related KBs, misleading information,
wasting Engineers' Time and slowing down problem resolution
While searching for KBs to support resolution of customer inquiries 

a Small enhancement to the search Algorithm to refine results:
Solution has two parts:

1- Adding a new search tab "Skill Group" tab to filter results
Example: for VNX Product, there are many different Subgroups 
"Hardware - Software - Connectivity/Replication - Performance - etc"

2- Adding a category  to Submitted KBs "type of skill group(s)" 
which will show which Sub-Group the KB is related to
It will provide Finer search results, as it will remove many unwanted results
 Decreasing Engineer wasted time, enables Engineer to reach resolution faster
also, overall Better customer satisfaction
