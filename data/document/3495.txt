Periodical Medical Check-ups for Employees

Idea implemented in a relative employer abroad
The idea is to have a program within EMC to check on employees healths periodically(each 6 months or 12 months)

Going through this, the employee will maintain good health and be more productive in their jobs. It is a precausious process for the employee before they, God Forbid, discover a disease that they have without knowing.

From cost perspective, medical checkups will be cheaper than the medicines they will need if they discover a severe desease that will cost good money on EMC
