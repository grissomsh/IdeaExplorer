Data protection regulatory compliance using geo specific RSA Security model

One of our cloud project customers was concerned to move the data cloud because of this reason.
At the RSA AxM administration level there should be provision to define the policies which tell which data can be accessed from which region.
By collection users location information from browser and send it to RSA AxM for authentication and authorization we can address the data protection issue.
Based on location information passed by browser, RSA AxM will validate whether the user is authorized to access data or not.
