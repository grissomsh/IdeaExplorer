Voice notes' communicator

Simplifying the ways of communication with the Account managers or any person you have to reach them regularly will help alot in getting things achieved and done in a faster way and without being a load on others.
Based on my experience in dealing with the account managers I found most of them are busy and have no time to make a call or even chat with them through the communicator

So why not to have a voice note in our communicator as it is a way faster to deliver something in the faster way without wasting their or our time.
