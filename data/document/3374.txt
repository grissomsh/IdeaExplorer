Use Google Chromebooks instead of traditional laptops

Chromebooks do not have an operating system or any installed programs. They access everything in the cloud, starting from storage to programs such as word processing. This means that they are inexpensive since they do not need powerful processing, however they do need a fast and reliable network connecttion.
