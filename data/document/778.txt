o	Tapping pattern can consist of number of taps and speed (rhythm)
o	Similar to gestures commonly done via mouse on a desktop computer or swipes of
        the finger on a smartphone
o	Correct pattern can do an action, including open an app or trigger a sequence of 
        actions (similar to Android app “Trigger” or “Llama”, or how NFC tags are 
        commonly used). This is often called a “macro”.

o	Particularly useful for smartwatches and IoT devices
o	Not necessarily better than macros by voice, except that people are often
        reluctant to speak to their devices around other people (e.g. in public)
o	Immune to fingerprint reverse-engineering
