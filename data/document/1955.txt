Tie up with any Global Health Organisation
The idea is to gets tie-up with any Global Health Organisation such as BEST DOCTOR's so that any one can get the Second/Third Opinion, right diagnosis and advice from global experts.
I came up with this idea last quater(Q1'15) only, when my younger brother was going through critical laparoscopic surgery in my native town. Before surgery i just want to get 2nd opinion from one of the Global organisation or doctor's. 

I did get in touch with EMC HR & Health services and they informed they dont have any kind tie-up with any Global Health services.

But while i was with Symantec(2008-2013), they had tie-up with BEST DOCTOR's and every employee got benifited across the world. 
If EMC gets tie-up with any Global Health Organisation then any employee in EMC through out the world can approach for Second/Third Opinion for them & as well as any of their family members.
This will benefit the employees across globe and also provide Global Health and Safety benefit Programs.
