Information both ways

We get customers that want to know the roadmap of our products and I know how EMC wants Customer feedback so this is a win win situation.   


Having a bi-weekly update sent on this application gives customers the sense of loyalty and importance. This way they would be useful and start sending us their feedback and discuss with us issues real-time.  This is a two way communication that will be beneficial helping everyone get what they need.
