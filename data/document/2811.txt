Single pane of glass for VM-level data protection continuum in DPA.
- Bridging the gap in data protection solutions by connecting backup and replication
- The need to meet more stringent SLAs with exponential data growth
- Giving vAdmins an easy-to-use solution for monitoring their virtual environment protection since the
Roi raised the subject of continuum in a brainstorming session we had in the Beer Sheva Cross-BU meeting. This was followed up by Kfir and Roi who further developed the solution for virtual environments.
We suggest a single pane of glass for VM-level (or vApp-level) data protection continuum in DPA. This screen will show all VM recovery-points in a simple Unified View for both Backup and Replication data copies.
The user will be able to easily monitor their SLAs and auditing requirements while DPA will do all the work behind the scenes.
As far as we know, such a unique solution does not exist today.
Our innovation suggestion will aggregate information from the following sources:
-	Backup application, e.g. Avamar and Networker – copies created by periodic backup jobs.
-	RecoverPoint for VMs – VM replication RP snapshots.
-	VMware vCenter (VC) – VM snapshots.
-	and any other VM-level protection solution.
This idea will also apply if there are several VMs in a vApp (in a single consistency-group).
Security: Minimal credentials – our solution requires users to provide credentials only to the backup and replication agents and does not need passwords to access vApp data.
-	Allow this feature to enhance the user experience in the next versions of DPA
-	Improve vAdmins and other users’ satisfaction with the DPA product and optimize their environment protection monitoring.
