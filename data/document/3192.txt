Saftey comes first 

I have attended several trainigs that has to do with safety and security , so i thought if it can be customized into one mandatory training
The boot camp, new hire induction program will include a mandatory training named safety comes firt. This course will include what to do in fire drill , some first aid training as well as how to act in dangerous situations
