HR Challenge

We can segregate the existing data based on the motivating agents. Few parameters can be (Responsibility, Professional growth, recognition etc.). This has high impacts on employee morale then the hygiene factors which are (working conditions, salary, relationships at work, security, status etc). 

We can build a process, where we can prioritize to implement these actions at all levels.

All managers need to be trained on these factors, so they understand how helpful these things can be to manage their respective teams. Again managers are the ones who can influence the employee.

To measure if things are effective â€“ we can set a process to ensure there is a regular 1:1 connect between the manager & the team member. And put a map in place to see, what the key findings were & what the current status is.
Positively these actions will give us the intended results.

This is one of the Human Resource Management concept.
