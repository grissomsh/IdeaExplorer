Highly Efficient, Intelligent Converged Resource Provisioning Solution with Cumulus + OnRack
Enable more BUs to do as much as possible automation in data center/Labs/MFG to replace manual work.
Further integrate and apply GPO's technology and platform with 3rd platform. 
Makes more BU to install & use the OnRack and Cumulus product.
Identifies a way to handle CI solution provisioning with our owned solution & technology.
We've raised some other ideas separately (#2015000470, #2015001668) for Cumulus and OnRack and then thought of integrating them together as a converged solution for MFG automation, management and orchestration of all hardware resources in MFG/Lab/data centers.
Cumulus is designed to handle automation & orchestration of all hardware resources in the MFG (including products and test equipment), while OnRack is the GHE M&O solution. Integrated together, they can provide the power of MFG automation, management and orchestration of all hardware resources in MFG/Lab/data centers.
