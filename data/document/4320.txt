Generate backup strategy on demand 

I came up with the idea when considering data recover stragety.
Generate backup strategy on demand will have advantages as below:
1. Improve system performance and resource efficiency
2. Decide whether full or incremental backup from through put will reduce cost on storage and time to data recover
