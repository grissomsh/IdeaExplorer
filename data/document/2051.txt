Front-End : The front-end of this app is being developed with ExtJs4 and hence it works seamlessly in different browsers(IE, Mozilla, chrome etc). As the underlying technology is from Sencha it can be seamlessly ported to any mobile platform without any extra effort (SenchaTouch).

Back-End : Back-end is being developed with Spring & Mongodb. As Mongodb is a NOSQL database, this app will scale easily.

Deployment-Platform : Final app can be deployed on a Virtualization platform like Vcloud Director.
