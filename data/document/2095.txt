The Upgrade Enhancemet project
I chose the end to end business process challenge, my idea will help to improve the upgrade process by increasing the customer awarness & satisfaction which will meet the challenge criterias.

An attached file to every quote sent to the customer reflected by the hotkeys like the quote and the terms & conditions, this file may include : 
•	The explanation of the upgrade. 
•	The rules & regulations of an upgrade. 
•	The importance of an upgrade. 
As a reminder to the customer and to increase the customer awareness. The customer may ignore this document or he can consider it as a waste of time but from our end, when we send to the customer that we will close the SR as he is not eligible and the customer get mad we can reply that in every quote we send to you there is a file attached to explain  the upgrade regulations. (that way we will reduce the number of disputes & overrides)
.while selling an EMC product or solution, we need to inform the customer that  you will need to upgrade your product, and to provide him with a document that explains everything related to the upgrade. So later on we can avoid customers stating, what do you mean by upgrade? Or why I am not eligible for support. 
Customer satisfaction, making money as the customer will realise that he will need to extend his contract so he can upgrade. The idea will also enhance the process and will reduce the time spent trying to explain to the unhappy customer that you are not eligible for support.
