New Hires/ GSAP's should have a senior GSAP and a technical Mentor assigned to them.
We always take time to open up with the new team and therefore having some one with you who has already went through the same process helps you to have a better understanding on day to day process .
I as a Gsap , I had a GSAP mentor and a tech mentor with me and as per my experience I think that this should be taken across the CS and other BU's as well. It will be good for the new GSAP's to ask the GSAP mentors when they face some issues with product or it may be the way to handle the situation.
We can have better understanding and knowledge sharing and its easy to open up with the same age group and also helps to share our own thoughts easily.
As a GSAPer they will feel more comfortable when they ask questions to GSAP mentor rather then asking to technical Mentor also it will reduce the time taken for the GSAPs to go live. also we will build up good bonds in short time span.
