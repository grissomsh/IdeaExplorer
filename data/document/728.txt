Enhanced collaboration model promoting diversity and innovation
The idea suggests a model for increasing collaboration between employees and Federation sites and taking advantage of the current talent diversity at EMC. It also proposes a way to measure the impact of the diverse innovation team versus a non-diverse innovation team.
Came up with this idea when reviewing this year challenges and observed a high demand for increasing collaboration between employees and Federation sites.
We propose a model (which can work as a web-based or mobile application) where each employee can register by specifying his areas of expertise and areas of general interest. (Initial set of these areas can be suggested automatically based on employs position and her\his previously submitted patents and innovations.) Then any employee or team can publish a question or general directions related to their innovation process, and mark the areas where they seek for collaboration with others. The question will be routed to the relevant registered employees, which review the question and, if found relevant, reach out to the asking team with the suggestions. This allows initiating collaboration between previously unknown people from different teams worldwide and thus increasing diversity of thinking through the innovation processes.  

For measuring the impact of the diverse innovation team versus a non-diverse team we propose to use statistical and machine learning models. In these models each team can be described by variety of diversity related features, such as female-male ratio, age variance metrics, number of different languages, countries of birth, nations among team members, etc. The target variable(s) can be any innovation ‘success’ measure(s) such as number of accepted patents, number of submitted, finalist or winner innovation ideas submitted by the team members. Given such a representation, statistical and machine learning methods, such as regression, classification and correlations analysis, can be used for measuring the effect of diversity on the innovativeness of the team. It also allows quantifying the level of importance for various diversity factors. Additionally expected level of innovativeness can be estimated for any existing or planned team.
The implemented idea would look like a web-based and\or mobile application; and it will be a “success” if people start using the application for collaboration and innovation processes. We can quantify the success by measuring number of innovations and approved patents submitted by more diverse teams.
Additional benefits:
•	Easy implementation
•	Promotes collaboration and communication between Federation members 
•	Scalable across Platform 2.0 to Platform 3.0 innovations
•	Include the global nature of EMC
