Lightweight Search service for Syncplicity
Integrate Syncplicity with search service.
Brainstorm xPlore new feature.
Syncplicity is a hybrid-cloud storage solution. Customers have the requirement to search the repositories on Syncplicity. Our solution is implementing an on-premise lightweight search engine based on Lucene, and LDA keywords extract.
1. Base on Lucene. To meet the lightweight and fast requirement, SyncSearch will be implemented based on basic Lucene. File adding, updating, or removing event will notify SyncSearch to update index.
2. Keywords/Full-text Search dual modes. LDA can extract keywords from articles, in topic mode, SyncSearch use those keywords instead of full-text to index article, so customer can find the document with the topic faster.
3. Secure Search. This search engine has the secure search ability, inherit ACL information from Syncplicity Rights Management Server.


Customers can deploy high-quality and high-performance topic/full-text on-premise search service.
