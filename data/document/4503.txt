InfiniBand for VNX/VMAX

We are doing a project that can compete with Oracle Exadata Database Machine; our goal is trying to provide the same or more capacity and computing power with less TCO.  The Exadata are equipped with many infiniBand QDR (40Gbit/s) front-end ports, which is 5 times fast than the old FC (8Gbit/s). So we have to setup many Server nodes and equipped as many HBAs on these node to get the same throughput like Exadata did, which is a big lost for EMC.
An InfiniBand link is a serial link operating at one of five data rates: single data rate (SDR), double data rate (DDR), quad data rate (QDR), fourteen data rate (FDR), and enhanced data rate (EDR). The SDR connection's signaling rate is 2.5 gigabit per second (Gbit/s) in each direction per connection. DDR is 5 Gbit/s and QDR is 10 Gbit/s. FDR is 14.0625 Gbit/s and EDR is 25.78125 Gbit/s per lane.Implementers can aggregate links in units of 4 or 12, called 4X or 12X. A 12X QDR link therefore carries 120 Gbit/s raw, or 96 Gbit/s of useful data. As of 2009 most systems use a 4X aggregate, implying a 10 Gbit/s (SDR), 20 Gbit/s (DDR) or 40 Gbit/s (QDR) connection. Larger systems with 12X links are typically used for cluster and supercomputer interconnects and for inter-switch connections.
