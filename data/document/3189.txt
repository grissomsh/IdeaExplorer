Monthly meets for Clients, Partners and EMC representatives

As we work in customer support, we are directly contacting customers and hence this idea seemed to help them better than what could be done through documents and email notifications.
The meetings described above should have limited audience including few interested clients, partners and few of our representatives. This should be done at BU level so we are able to connect to customer's need well and so we can focus on addressing them. These meets should happen regularly atleast for few months until we have spread our message and till the time we have covered all our customers. This will build a stronger rapport and keep them with us than heading towards a competitor too. Most of our forums are now full with educational videos and documents but clients do not know how and where to access them. Such sessions will help them connect to these websites and utilize them well. Also, we could invite suggestions and feedback from them on how they would want such sites to be.
