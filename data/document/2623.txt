Pixion: Image-Based Associative Authentication
Associative Authentication is a new authentication method based on each user's personal associations with selected images - rather than relying on facts that can be easily discovered through social engineering, image associations are highly personal for e
We developed this idea during the RSA Israel 2nd Hackathon (June 3, 2015) and created a demo application to demonstrate the approach.

1.	Enrollment: User is presented with a list of public images, and the users can additionally upload their own image(s). For each image chosen, they are required to provide a phrase that they associate with the image, either via text or voice entry.

The user identifies the correct image and provides the associated phrase for this image.
3.	Authentication: The userâ€™s answer is checked against the answer provided during enrollment, by exact match or using a fuzzy logic (to allow for differences in grammar, spelling, etc.).
Associative Authentication can be sold as part of the Adaptive Authentication product offerings, and is also a perfect step up authentication method for a mobile device.  It would increase customer satisfaction, with reduced calls about forgotten password
