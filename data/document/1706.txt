Give Blood application
The challenge is about how we can use EMC solutions and the the federation products in order to control, manage and make analysis on vast quantities on chaotic information. My idea is a combination of the Federation integrated solution and a mobile application used in healthcare sector in order to solve blood shortage problem in Blood Banks. 
The idea has no history.
My idea is to make a database with the blood donors volunteers who donate blood for community supply with their personal information, blood type, the last time of donation and latest medical reports, so if we have a situation of a blood shortage in blood banks in a hospital and we need individuals to direct donate blood we can make analysis on the data we have based on the blood type that is urgently needed, the medical reports of individuals to be sure that the donation is not hazardous to their health and their locations or addresses to grep the donors who are near to the hospital that needs blood. After making the analysis we make a list of donors who ready to donate with blood and contact them or send them notifications if they use the mobile application. At the same time we send notifications for the donors on the mobile application to remind them with the periodic medical checkups to be sure that they are ready to donate blood at anytime. 
My idea can work technically by:
1) Using Isilon as a storage solution to store the database integrated with Hadoop which is an open source solution to make big data analysis.
2) Use hybrid cloud solution (ex: VCloud Air) or open source solutions (ex: open stack and cloud stack) so the hospital keep the medical reports of their patients secured on private cloud and keep information about the blood types and donations on public cloud to be shared with other hospitals.   
If the idea is implemented it will help in solving the blood shortage problem and contribute in saving people's life.
