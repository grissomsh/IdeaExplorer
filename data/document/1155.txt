On-site DAE screen and refurb (MFG Apex)
Global Product Operations Challenge:
-make GPO/EMCâ€™s supply chain and manufacturing operations more efficient and effective
-drive cost out of our operations to enable investment in Platform 3

Idea initiated and implemented by Hong Zou in Apex.  Hong observed the dollars we were spending on this activity and worked with her team mates to identify an on-site solution - equipment, personnel, training. She was able to establish the process and is ready to hand it over to operations to maintain going forward. 
Set up a FRU screening and DAE conversion process in Apex Mfg to avoid vendor test and rework charges. 
Based on history and volume projections, net savings from the FRU screening is estimated to be $160K per year.  Net savings on Voyager DAE conversions is estimated to be $300K per year.
