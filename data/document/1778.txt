IoT Message Buffer Switches
This would help us create a differentiator in the fast growing IoT market as well as give us potential products in the networking space.
I was researching Internet of Things in support of some Market Intelligence research and was thinking of ways to improve resiliency over congested networks.
This solution suggests creating localized message brokers near the end points such as in cellular towers.  Local towers would create clusters for availability with the regional aggregation stations or even with other local towers.  The centralized controller would handle cluster membership and could create differing clusters for different data sources to improve resiliency based on the source location.  A paxos based system such as Zookeeper would be used for distributed state.  The up-stream system, possibly another IoT node or processing system, would consume the messages in batch, allowing it to control the network utilization without losing data. Each level would have a separate cluster to ensure resiliency and staging.
This would be a new product that served as a centrally managed network switch with the embedded messaging capability.  This message capability would be at the layer 7 application level and implement a high throughput message system such as Apache Kafka.  This up-levels the interface from simple IP mechanisms, allowing for advanced distribution and other capabilities. The software defined networking mechanisms would be used to control cluster membership based on network connectivity and routing. It would be packaged and sold as an appliance, with different versions for fixed and wireless networking, as well as end-point versus backbone.
