Car-pooling APP
This idea would allow people working within EMC to share the same car when driving to work or when attempting trainings in other sites. This would improve collaboration between EMC employees and also communication across EMC BUâ€™s. 
The idea was a product of a group innovation workshop incorporating employees across various teams within CS. The program was facilitated by co-ops. The idea was discussed and refined through group collaboration.
We propose to create one App where people within EMC can share the same car while traveling to work or attempting training sessions in other sites.
Basically this APP would gather the information from the people that have car and want to share it, within this information it would gather location from-where people are traveling and departure times.

The benefits and success of this idea would be better utilization of resources (cars), employees would save money, less pollution and definitely better collaboration and communication between EMC employees. These journeys would help people to know each other and talk about their position in EMC.
