Vplex design Simulator

Problems I face during the design of big vplex project with several arrays in backend.
Have a simulator where the vplex and Backend array are simulated. 
So this works as follows:
Add a vplex, select the number of engines
Input the backend array with it's specifications (cache, number of drives ..etc)
connect the cables from vplex backend to the array.

simulate a workload curve based on IO profiles.

This is useful in case of having several backend arrays. How many ports to dedicate to which array or use port sharing between the arrays

This could be useful in optimizing the vplex performance.
