My company <--> My collage 

- Many people in India do not know about EMC 
- I always felt going back to my college and doing this
How it work - 

Any employee which is interested in doing this should be facilitated with EMC's banner.

What employee will do- 
1. Plan a workshop in his/her collage on any of the various fields where EMC is working, for eg
   - SAN
   - Cloud 
   - EMC ( A detailed presentation of what EMC is into and what are the technologies in which EMC is champion and how it is one of best companies in world)

2. Employee in his/her college can talk on ways how to get into different area eg, SAN, cloud and talk about career in EMC

3. Give a structured path (how to get certification), this will increase Education department's revenue as well

Looking at a bigger picture, more people will be aware of the certifications EMC provides, and down the line there are possibilities to improve this program even better encouraging more and more students to do to certification

Advantage - 
EMC revenue will increase (Cisco generate a good amount of revenue for its certification)
EMC will have more options to choose a knowledgeable work force out of fresh college graduate
Popularity of EMC will increase in India
