Machine Management tool
This solves the lab maintenance problem faced by the teams.
We have been experiencing the above stated problem in our team. So we came up with this idea.
Our solution will be a Machine management tool which will have following features:
1. Get the details of the servers under a single page.
2. Display the version of the OS installed ( ESX/Wind/Linux).
3. Lock a machine and assign it to a user.
3. Check for the license of the servers and alert the admin/user on this on expiry through mails.
4. Provide admin user for full control of the tool. Normal user login to view the ownership of the machines and status of each machines.
5. In the same tool we can allot the ips to the individuals in the team. Later we can generate a report on how the ips are used by the team, count the ips for each individual. Thus IP management in the team becomes transparent and easier to maintain.
If this idea is implemented, this can be used across EMC by every team. It will be easier to manage the lab machines and its corresponding IP address, licenses etc . Also the transparency of the IPs allotted to the team will be clear. This will optimize the way the work is carried out in the team.
