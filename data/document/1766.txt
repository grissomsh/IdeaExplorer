Culture exchange by sharing and experiencing different festival traditions
Sharing and experiencing festivals of different countries within EMC can help people not just knowing and understanding different cultures, but also emotionally feel closer to each COE; and thus enhance much more respect to diversity in EMC.  
In 2013, ECD China received one special gift. It was two tanks of goose liver posted from French COE for thanking the helps from China team. Luckily a lot of people in ECD China has shared the yummy. We were ones of them. That event has crossed the many gaps between China and French teams: the distance, the culture, and even the feelings. We sent back our thank mail and pictures. Suddenly, the two teams far from each other have feel much closer and warmer. A simple event has built up a tight band among us.
This is where the idea come from. 
The main focus of this idea is to supply chance for people to feel and experience festival traditions in different countries. 
Below outlines how the system works (below takes an example of how people in China to go with the program when people in India is going to have a festival):
India has very different culture as well as different festivals from China. But people in China has very limited knowledge about how people in India spend their festivals -  what do they eat? what do they play? where do they go?
HR can organize a series of events to have people in China to experience India's festival when India COE is in a festival. 

a. Before the festival
- Sending email to everyone of EMC one week earlier to tell everyone India is going to have a festival. Below information could be involved in that mail:
     * Date,  whether people have native holidays, and how many days.
     * Introduction about the festival - about the traditional - what do they normally eat? 
     * Better to have videos
     * Share some other media about the festival - such as the pictures from India COE from past years
b. When festival is happening
- Organize a series activities with some prepared traditional goods people in India normally use/eat during that festival (foods, dresses, and some other goods). People in China can attend those activities to feel and taste the culture of India.
- Encourage people in India COE to share their videos and pictures. 
     * HR put all those pictures in some worldwide sharing folders with well-organized structure (e.g. create folders with year, festival, and COE. Picture/Videos are named with the recorder's names).
     * HR picks pictures that can represent the culture of India well and share them with everyone in a mail/wiki page with a link in a mail.
- Ask India colleagues who is in China to share their experience. People from China can have the opportunity to ask interesting questions about the festival.
c. After the festival
- Collect the feedback of China employees, and quote what do they want to do in next festival; and also ask China people to start prepare for next Chinese festival and get ready for sharing with other COEs.

- Gives much more respect to diversity - people with different colors, cultures.
- People in EMC will feel all EMC COEs are an unique, whole and warmly family - we are sharing the same world, and we are sharing the same life.
