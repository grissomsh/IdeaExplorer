C Vs Management Tool for the HR
This idea will help the HR to Manage the C Vs they receive and categorize them according to the relevant vacancy.
The idea came up when i had a training in the HR department , i though of that there should exist a tool to automates the process they do and minimize the time they consume to filter the  C vs one by one to find the fitting candidate. 
My solution is a tool to consolidate all the applications received or C Vs referrals from internal employees in one system , using Sentiment analytic technology those C vs can be Categorized if a job vacancy needs certain language preferences, specific certifications or programming skills.

This will automates the process of screening for the HR and automatically suggests the fitting candidates for the corresponding available job vacancies.
1-Facilitates the process of C Vs screening.
2-Automates the process of Allocating the Relevant candidate to the corresponding job vacancy.
3-Consolidating the C Vs received from different resources in one system for better management.
