PS lead by sales (Sales lead organization)

observed delays in many delivery cases, resulted in un happy customer and negative impact on sales.
Smaller groups of PS delivery team, including SA, IS, & PM, lead by Sales & SE.
Each Sales rep/SE will own the team of few PS resources and will be involved in end to end delivery of the product / project. 

This will cut short the time required in coordination between different managers, RM and reduce delays related to inter office hierarchy and thus improve delivery and reduce cost.  

This will result EMC in becoming more customer focus organization.
