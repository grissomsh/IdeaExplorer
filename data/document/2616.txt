Hands On Diversity Emersion
This program is focused on introducing employees to the existing diversity within EMC in a hands on fashion. This program will place employees in a new environment to experience different cultures, aspects of EMC and workplace practices.
Our team was looking through the innovation challenges and once we read this we immediately thought of this idea. A handful of us were required to attend diversity training and felt that this was a much more interactive and possibly more effective approach. We discussed the idea and put together the submission.
This approach is unique because it is a hands on approach to educating employees on the diversity within EMC. The only other approach we are aware of (or have been involved in) is a classroom presentation showing statistics about diversity. There is no exposure to what makes everyone truly diverse. Networking is essential and what better way to take advantage of EMCâ€™s diversity by allowing cross collaboration? The solution would be to develop a program to allow employees to travel to different EMC locations across the world and learn what it is like to work in that office on a daily basis. It would be similar to a student exchange program. For a short period of time an employee would work out of a foreign office completing their own work, or another groups work (if possible) and learning about another aspect of the business. They would also learn how a different office operates on a daily basis. Manager groups that are willing to participate could be paired with other groups that they may not deal with on a regular basis. 

This program could increase productivity, creativity and innovation. This challenge is geared towards bringing a more diverse outlook on the innovation process, by fully immersing employees into the already existing diverse infrastructure.
