Different databases support for Captiva and Documentum
ECD has different products like Captiva and Documentum but these products are supported with very limited database versions/types
Customers have raised concerns to have support on Oracle for Captiva which triggers the idea of supporting different DB servers
Use a technology like Hibernate so as to use different database servers/versions. This would highly benefit customers using ECD products 
Customer will have different options for back end systems and ease up their licensing problems
