Realtime Search by integrating xPlore and XtremeIO
EMC Documentum xPlore is a full-text search engine built on Lucene and xDB. As a search engine, performance and stability is always considered important. Integrating xPlore and XtremeIO makes benefit to both XtremeIO and xPlore:
1. xPlore uses XtremeIO as the storage can improve the indexing throughput and reduce search latency.
2. XtremeIO can leverage xPlore as a search service to search documents in the storage.
When developing xPlore, we got many customer cases related to search/index performance. We tested xPlore running on different environment and found better IOPS can lead to better performance. We are sure XtremeIO can improve the xPlore performance dramatically.
We propose to integrate xPlore with XtremeIO to get the realtime search experience.
xPlore as a search engine is IO intensive. Ingestion and index merging requires read/write operations, and search requires read operations. In a large organization, many indexing and searching request run in parallel. Sometimes xPlore will throttle indexing for search requests, but the search result may not get updated index in realtime.
XtremeIO is all-flash arrays with high performance. Here are the solutions:
1. Install xPlore on XtremeIO, feed data to xPlore and compare the performance between other environment and XtremeIO.
2. Try to leverage XtremeIO in-memory snapshots in xPlore hot upgrade (upgrade without shutting down) and backup.
3. Leverage XtremeIO high availability for xPlore.
 
Another proposal is to install xPlore as a service in XtremeIO, leverage xPlore to index XtremeIO document, then XtremeIO will have full text search capability.
Integrating xPlore and xtremeIO will benefit both xPlore and xTremeIO. xPlore will have better performance and more Documentum customers will have requirement for XtremeIO. Due to the adding-on search capabilities, XtremeIO will also be suitable for customers who have realtime full text search requirements.
