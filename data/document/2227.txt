Efficiency Enhancement platform for Software Defined Data Center Based on GPU General Computing
This idea provides a solution to improve SDS efficiency with low cost. After involving GPU computing on heavy CPU utilized features, we may even reduce cost on other part since the process efficiency has been highly improved by GPU parallel computing.
This idea came out after I submitted my first innovation showcase. GPU computing is developed in recent years, has a huge development potential. The ViPR is powerful but will meet huge data processing challenge. I notice that we can use efficiency enhancement cloud based on GPU general computing to embrace this challenge, so here is the idea. 
It can be implemented with EMC new ViPR Software-Defined Storage Platform. It can be set up easily without changing ViPR so much. The hardware of the Efficiency Enhancement Cloud consists of a cluster of computers with GPU general computing ability(like Nvidia graphic card with CUDA) on each. We need implement an GPU on ESXi server which used to install ViPR. Before this platform is set up, when ViPR need process data/computing, the only way is using the CPU computing ability. But now, it can use the GPU to process parallel computing, to improve the performance. The GPU computing is used to process the tasks which are suit for computing in parallel. First, initiate the data/tasks need to be processed to many tasks on CPU side. Then, send the tasks to GPU and wait for the results sent back. The other tasks which is not suit for GPU are still processed by CPU.  

In general, this case can improve efficiency on server which used to run ViPR. For the whole solution, more than 3 times improvement is possible. We only need to add one graphic card into our storage system, which cost less than $1000 per server.
