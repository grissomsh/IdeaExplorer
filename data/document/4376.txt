EMC Carpooling Mobile App

The idea was generated from my personal experience, suffering from Cairo's traffic jam and scarcity of parking slots, a carpooling system will definitely help me.
If driving takes a big bite out of your budget and your time and if EMC transportation is not convenient for you, here is the solution “EMC Carpooling Mobile App”. 

The idea is develop a mobile application that would allow EMC employees to car pool together. The application will work as follow:

1- Employees will register their names, addresses (pickup/drop-off points), working hours. 
2- Employees with same district and working hours will be grouped together 
3- A schedule will be generated per group to arrange the commute details (driver/day, pickup time and number of occupants/day).
4- Employees can check their schedules every day to better organize with the commuters.
5- The app can also suggest the best route for employees to take while coming/leaving the office to avoid traffic jams. 

This idea would have the following benefits:
1- Carpooling will allow employees to cut their expenses by nearly 50% or more.
2- Carpooling is a great way to make new friends.
3- Carpooling offers a commuter option that may work better than other methods of transportation. 
4- Carpooling will help free up parking space.
