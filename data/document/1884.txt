Licensing Refresh Groups
We are a global team and we have new updates, products and processes every day that we try to keep up with and learn. Further, some of our daily tasks are being done differently from one team member to another which created differences in how we provide services. 

This is highly related to the end to end business process challenge and also the diversity and innovation challenge as it will involve team members from all over the world.
This idea came through after seeing the differences in how team members handle licensing issues, along with some mistakes that can be avoided. Further, after seeing how quick we are moving and developing and the large number of new products we are handling. 
The idea is to create a monthly focus group that would include different licensing specialists every month. This group sits together and will conduct a refresh session to share knowledge of new products, updates, difficult/unique cases they had encountered and how they were solved. Members can prepare what they want to share and ask colleagues questions to see how things are done.
This will bridge the knowledge gap.
Get everyone trained on all products.
