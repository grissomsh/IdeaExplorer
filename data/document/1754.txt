Challenge portal
My solution is a portal that helps employees to solve their  problems and challenges related to Business.
The Idea came to me at the beginning of my work at EMC. I thought about how old employees could share experience and knowledge with recent employees. also how recent employees could share new ideas with the upper management.

The core idea of the portal is mainly sharing and participating in a secure manner.

It's kind of a forum, employees will be able to post a question, challenge or a problem that needs to be solved.

They also have the chance to Answer posts and vote for best answers.

Employees will have virtual identity, their real identity will be hidden in a secure manner so as to encourage openness.
 
This Idea will encourage innovation for challenges in Global EMC in general as it support sharing knowledge and experience over different cultures and backgrounds.

It will also helps employees to develop and engage in EMC business.
