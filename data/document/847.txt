Service to analyze VMAX issue using vVMAX in QE/Production environments
This idea would improve Supportability and troubleshooting speed. This is also lead to better resource utilization
During Volga release time frame, due to initial development phase, boxes were held for triage by developers for long duration leading to resource crunch.
This idea can help recreating the scenario using vVMAX, so that the actual VMAX box can released ASAP.
Come up with a service that could analyze the various dumps that are collected in a VMAX and recreate the exact scenario or sequence of steps that had occurred in order to hit the issue. In this case we can leverage a vVMAX in order to recreate the scenario so that the time to resolve the issue shortens.


High resource utilization
Issue recreation and testing in a controlled environment
No additional investment required as vVMAX is a software component
This gives additional flexibility to developers to resolve the issue once it is recreated in lab environments
