ADD-on that detect a phone number and give you the option to call it with the cisco phone 

sometimes i waste my time to call a customer specially when he is not in the same country , or dial a wrong number so what about having a small tool that can make phone call easier and prevent human mistakes 
User can only hover over the number and when he use the right click the tool detect the number and give him the option to call him from PC , call him using the Cisco phone
