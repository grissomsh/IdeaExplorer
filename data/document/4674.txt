Innovation Development Contest

I have an idea of contest for developers for our St. Petersburg COE.
Choose interesting, challenging and useful for customer ideas from the list, publish them and organize the annual contest. Two or three ideas will be enough. 
Contest is a competition between employees. Employees take a task which they like, create a teams and make a prototype in one or two months. Several teams may take part in the contest. After the deadline judges will test the prototypes and select the winner. The fist price might be 5000$ and/or opportunity to start your own project. 

To my mind, it is a great opportunity and excitement for employee (team) to compete in such Challenge, create something and win. These prototypes might become a feature of a product or a new one!
Also, I think that it is great if managers will encourage employees, like give them 10/20% of the working time for taking part in the Contest.
