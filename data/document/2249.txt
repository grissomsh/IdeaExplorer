VPN algorithm
Addressing the security challenge providing easy authentication for authorized users and hard access for unauthorized ones when accessing the corporate network through the V.P.N
specifically in times of disasters or revolutions ,where the Employees can not go to the corporate and are obligated to work from home. 
I entered the pass-code wrong twice and I was blocked.So I had no choice but to go to the company contact the IT help disk from inside the company using the cable.Suppose there was a crisis or a revolution that prevents the employees from going to the company.We will not be able to work unless we contacted a fellow employee ,gave him all the passwords of the other employee and told him to contact the IT help disk for us.This is not so secure.There is also a big probability that communications might be cut.So this algorithm ensures the security and privacy of the employees data in the worst possible scenarios that could happen.Th idea is simple ,doable and will not consume effort or money.
My solution is an algorithm using the very personal information of the employee and hashing this information.When the employee type his pass-code wrong twice then we ask him to enter his personal information ,hash it and compare this hash with the one we have.If they do not match then lock his token,if they do then ask him for his pass-code again ,if he entered it correctly then he can access ,if not then he is locked. 
If my idea is implemented then even during disasters,the flow of work can not be interrupted as you will not make exceptions.Security is ensured and we give a chance to the employees to make mistakes and correct them during accessing the corporate network.The process is automated and the load on IT help disk will decrease ensuring that  they will work on bigger issues and the IT team can be utilized with more efficiency.
