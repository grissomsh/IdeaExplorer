Provide electronic recycling services and metal recovery for all computer hardware and cabling regardless of manufacturer.

I have worked with computers personally for 30 years. As a recycler in my local township, I recycle as much plastic (all types) and paper that I can to keep it out of the landfill. I realized in thinking about the remaining items, like batteries, crt's, precious and toxic metals in electronic components, that most was heading to landfill because that is not picked up or handled. A local business provides a drop-off site for eWaste and accepts cabling too. I now offer to pick up broken/obsolete electronic items and worn out batteries from neighbors and friends to take when I go to the drop-off location. Doing my part.
Engage the customer to be green and be aware that most of the obsolete electronic items end up in a landfill including cabling and peripherals. Sites simply toss old cabling and items into dumpsters or compactors without thinking about recovery and where it actually ends up. We can offer to educate them on the toxic nature of improper disposal, create an eRecycling site plan, locate and engage suitable businesses around the customer site (where practical) and help create program to collect the items and pick them up to process for metal and plastic recovery/recycling. It is good business to be green and promote that as a business ethic. New EMC equipment at a site typically displaces a lot of other vendors equipment along with the cables, peripherals, etc that go with it and is not always taken in on trade where we handle its disposal.
