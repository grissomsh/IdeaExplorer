E-Mail based solution to retrieve KB articles 

When working at a customer site, we have very limited access to the internet and most importantly the EMC intranet. To search and view a KB article becomes challenge and sometimes even requires assistance from a colleague.
The idea is practical and fairly simple and easy to implement. 
1. Dedicate a server with some Mail Server instance on it
2. An e-mail address - to which all requests can be submitted
3. Send an e-mail with the KB ID you wish to retrieve
4. Receive a pdf copy of the KB article in your inbox

A repository will be maintained on the server and each time a query is submitted the KB article is saved in the repository. So the next time someone requests for the same article it is instantly send to the requester. 

This solution will be very helpful when we are at a customer site with no internet access and can use our smartphone to get the KB article.

The solution will be enhanced to request a KB article with its title.
