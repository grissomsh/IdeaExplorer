Reaching extream performance by InfiniBand host connectivity to X-brick
Performance enhancement to XtreamI/O X-brick to accommodate current/future world performance demand for data. 
Got this idea when I was looking at the current performance demand for Storage solutions in market.
InfiniBand host interface!

This performance improvement can be achieved by InfiniBand host interface.
Currently no Storage solutions provides InfiniBand host interface.(Most of the storages using it for internal communications ex. VMAX, X-Brick).

InfiniBand supports 100Gb/s interface today. Xtream I/O extremely unmatchable  performance If X-brick provides InfiniBand interface.


Trendsetter for performance demand growth. 
X-brick Cluster free performance demand.
