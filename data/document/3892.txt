Wear your Backup

the idea came up due to my interest to the wearable device technology, and after using different kinds of wearable devices.
 
The wearable device will have its own storage that can be synced through wireless technologies. Data will be stored on the wearable storage and/or downloaded to it and can be viewed through your mobile. Beside the data storage, the device will be socially aware and can have a fitness tracking feature
