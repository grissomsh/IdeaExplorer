EMC’s Virtual Demo Platform

We involve in many customer EBC demo @ India COE. Many times engineering has to get the setup built for such demo. If we can have this automated and customised, it would help many such demos. It can also be self driven by sales folks.
Create a virtual platform that has videos/bites/customer references. All this information is granular @
    Product Level – Example : NetWorker
    Release Level  - NetWorker : Version 8.2 – What’s new ?
    Solution Level – NetWorker with RSA lockbox or NetWorker with Vsphere
    Workflow Level – NetWorker Licensing or NetWorker DataDomain BOOST
User can browse at any level and get the video/references. We can also provide the information/videos in various category based on how much content is needed
    Basic – High Level Info in the form of small content or quick demo
    Advanced – All the information available in the form of all the relevant   
    excerpts and a comprehensive demo
Content/Demos are accessible (Access Controlled) to anybody on web/mobile 
Hits will be recorded that will create the behavioral pattern and an input to PRD/Roadmaps
Incase customer doesn’t find content/demo, we will have 48 hours SLA to come back to him with information.
