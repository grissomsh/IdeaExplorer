Data Safety project 

The idea was generated when I saw how the CEO is putting an emphasis on the need to ensure and promote the importance of data and personal security. 
Design and develop a process that would allow us promote and increase safety and security.

Safety and security of:
1-	Digital data (files, emails, images, ...etc)
2-	Personal data 
3-	Personal belongings (mobiles, laptops, keys,â€¦etc)

The process can be applied to protect any sort of data and should be demonstrated using visual aids. Ideas and processes will be assessed based on degree of security they provide and the creativity.
