Desktop as a Service (DaaS) for employees

Some of my colleagues are getting hardware failure on their laptops and they end being with no access their tools/resources till laptop is either replaced or fixed.

Having a method like VDI will address these issues and make everything more flexible.
Benefits:
-By using the resources of EMC's hybrid cloud, We can remove the headache of infrastructure issues.

-This will help IT units to be able to handle isuess quickly through using a centralized cloud platform.

-It will also save money because we won't need to spend money buying new laptops with high qualifications every while or replacing one of the broken devices with new one

-Having centralized platform to manage everything

Method:
-Each employee will have thin client on their laptops/desktops that connects through ip portal to access their Windows OS.

-Portal can be accessed through tablets also to make it more handy if the employee is outside the office.
