Business focus storage system base on collected big data
Storage systems are used in many business scopes and there are many competitors. While EMC has already been a leader in storage field, we need to improve our storage system with business related features rather than just a general storage system to attract customer and bind them to our products.
Storage system has been developed for a long time and they are always just a storage, but used by many kinds of customer. When customer is using a storage, he need to configure it and different customer uses the same kind of storage in different way. Customer like to use a use-friendly GUI, of course, he would like to use a use-friendly storage.
Base on collected big data, we can analyze and find out different storage requirements for different business and release a special release for a business which can help customer directly use it without too many configuration or having some performance improvement for a special requirement. For example, a multi-media company has many video data and their storage systems need a strong ability to suppport data reading.
When a multi-media company want to buy storage system, he will find that EMC storage system is so easy to use and has special configuration to support video files. Of course, he would like to get EMC storage system to support his business.
