Recycling usable drives that are not required for EMC products 
This will improve the efficiency of use of drives, reducing energy use to shred these and to manufacture replacements.
This can be implemented globally, there are 4 erasure sites within EMC, Franklin, Apex, Cork and Thailand.
This is easily implemented, just using spare capacity within the erasure cells.

This has been submitted by me before, a few times, but has not yet been implemented.

With little extra cost these drives could also be erased to remove all traces of customer data and either sold on to a 3rd party to recover costs and save recycling waste, or passed on to charities/schools for them to use / benefit from. We already have this Data Erasure process in place for all drives that are being returned to vendors or being re-used in manufacturing, to remove customer data, so these drives would just utilise spare capacity on these Erasure systems. 
Success can be measured by the reduction in waste material and possibly a new revenue stream from recycled drives.
