Clinical Archive as a Service-For Developing countries
This idea is venturing into a new business areas where we believe would make a lot of sense for EMC
We have been discussing this idea for many months within our team and believe having something is much needed for developing contries
Seeing this opportunity the solution we propose is to have a Clinical Archive as a service solution which would have these features:
      Platform which different MRS providers can easily integrate with their solution making it easily adoptable.  
      SAAS based. Should be able to integrate with the standalone systems (running in small clinics) as well as big cloud based systems.
	
We also believe partnering with companies like Practo would benefit EMC as they already have a platform with a big customer base and lack this capability. 

By bringing a stable product as service to the healthcare market, it would make more sense to crack through in providing the solutions to digital health care. Healthcare cost/expenditure is almost 18% of American GDP and in order to bring more success, we need to address the needs of lower/medium customer. Looking at the potential of the market expenditure, it becomes one of the much needed area where we need to have a solution to cater the requirement.
