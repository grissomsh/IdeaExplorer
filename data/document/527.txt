Peer to Peer support
a shorter and simpler process for collaboration and technical escalations between peers and team members located in different regions
after many cases i faced that could have been solved in no time if someone could quickly answer a question without having to go through technical escalation process or collaboration procedure

desktop tool or an application that every technical support engineer should have, each tool should be dedicated to each product, for example TSE working on Symmetrix in a region should be available on one tool, another one for VNX and so on.

- through this tool you can quickly ask regarding any issue and have an instant response from the one who know the answer, it's a more time saving application since you won't take time to start procedure to enter a collaboration or escalation unless it's a big issue and remote assistance is required.

it's a like a quick question and answer tool that can save time
having a tool dedicated for collaborations between team members would facilitate the process which would help quickly answering customer issues.
