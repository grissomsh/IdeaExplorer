Drinking Water Infrastructure and Environmental Disparities- Leverage IoT for healthier water
Potable drinking water is essential to public health; however, few studies have investigated income or racial disparities in water infrastructure or drinking water quality.

There were many case reports documenting a lack healthy of piped water or serious water quality problems in both low and high income and minority communities
I was thinking about the idea when I noticed that technology is not well employed in water supply management where we can benefit from it by using the advanced IoT based solutions where possible.
To implement quality sensors that can do some measurements regarding the water quality, leaks, and pipes quality to prevent any dangerous effects on the water quality and quantity to the subscribers.

such approach will help in the following 

1- Detect leaks once they happen without relying on the manual process.
2- maintains the pipes quality based on healthier standards.
3- Compare the water quality between the source and the target destinations to check whether there is any change that requires an immediate intervention.
4- Prolong the life time of the infrastructure.
