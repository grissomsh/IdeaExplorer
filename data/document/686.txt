Utilise project management techniques in supplier management for EMC supply chain.
I think my innovation idea will ultimately improve TCE and reduce costs for both EMC and our suppliers.
I've worked in supplier engineering for a number of years. I've encountered gaps in the handover processes both in EMC and at our suppliers. I'm also working on getting my PMP certification. I think we could use the techniques in PMP to better manage suppliers and ensure they are controlled properly. It is similar to the process of record (POR) we have for some suppliers but improves on that process expanding into the other project management knowledge areas.
My solution ensures all aspects of the project will be covered and documented from charter, scope, time, cost, quality, HR, communications, risk, procurement and stakeholder engagement all feeding up into a supplier management plan. This Supplier management plan can be used for the duration of the project and managed using project management techniques. It is better because it would ensure a similar standard of supplier management is in place across our supply chain and it would also ensure the entire process is managed effectively.
Having a supplier management plan would be an ideal way to ensure better and standardised steady state management of our suppliers, documenting our expectations and requirements and also ensure handovers are complete and ultimately ensure successful outcomes for both EMC and our suppliers and TCE and probably reduce costs to EMC and our suppliers.
