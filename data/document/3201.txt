EMC platform to build a data pivot and Analytic services for the IOT

NA
The idea is to build a data hub/pivot using EMC platforms such as Atmos. Atmos solves the constraints of the rigid mount point based interaction between the storage and the consumer.

Once the data is with in this data hub, 
Use Pivotal Bigdata suites to offer analytics as a service.
Use RSA Archer eGRC to offer Compliance as a service.
This would help EMC to stretch its reach to the Low end consumer based market. The stats say that an average home with 40 to 50 intelligent devices would generate a data of 200 TB per year (Courtesy: IDC Predictions).
