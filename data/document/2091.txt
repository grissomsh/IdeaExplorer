Energy efficiency by Performance Tuning the app
By performance tuning we can improve the energy efficiency
Own thought process
When designing the application when compared with application features generally performance and security are given least preference. A performance tuned application consumes lot of cpu cycles and hence lot of wastage of server energy. Consider an example: A badly designed bulk loading application takes 12 hours to complete, same can be tuned to run with in 2 hours. Hence saving 10 hours of cpu cycles.

Hence create a "Performance Lab", where the application will be designed with Performance in mind. Its not just the performance testing, include the performance as key process in the SDLC.
This not only saves energy but also as the application runs much faster, customers will be delighted.
