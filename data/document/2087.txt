A better way to protect cache data when power failure
1,Data protection,avoid data loss when power failure
2,Cost Efficiency,use small BBU instead of the current BBU
3,Customer Experience, a better way to protect the customer business data 
In the storage system, a write process will write to memory to be cached first,and then write to disk from memory in most cases. but when there is a power failure, the data which haven't write to the disk from memory will be lost. In order to protect the data in the memory, we could design a memory data protection mechanism when power failure.
1,add a power check module, it's used to monitor the status of power supply.
2,add a fast data cache module, it's used to copy the dirty data from the memory.
3,add a power failure protection controller module,it's used to notify the data cache module to copy the dirty data when power check module detected the power is failure.
4,add a small power supply module.it's used to supply the power to the memory and data cache module.

the data protection progress:
1,when power check module detected the power is failure, it will send a message to CPU to  finish the current must write process. and then shutdown the whole power
2,power check module active the small power supply module, the fast data cache module and power failure protection controller
3,power failure protection controller send a message to copy the dirty data from the memory to the fast data cache module. the data will not loss and make sure the data consistency and integrity.
4,when power supply is back to normal, the data in the fast data cache module will copy back to the memory. 
5,since the dirty were not flush to the disk(SSD/HDD), and they were still stored in the cache, the data access speed and efficiency will not affected.
If this idea was implemented, it will improve customer satisfaction and enhance the productivity. also it will optimize the data protection process
