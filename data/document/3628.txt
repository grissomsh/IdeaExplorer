Working for CST team, I can anticipate the great impact this program can have on employees' and customers' experience.
Identify critical talents within every CS BU.
Assess their potential and highlight their points of strength.
invest in advanced cross functional trainings.
optimize resources by putting in place a rotational schedule i.e. Employees can rotate on different BUs depending on BU needs and incoming volume.
