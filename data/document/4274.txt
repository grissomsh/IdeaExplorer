EMC radio station

I came up with the idea after I found out that there was no different communication channel for EMC employees. 
An EMC radio station will provide employees the space to express themselves and find new ways to put on shows that will help them in their EMC careers and social lives. EMC employees will themselves be the presenters and reporters of different shows making use of different EMC talents.
