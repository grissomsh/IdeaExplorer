Integrate Mozy cloud backup into OpenStack to provide enterprise level data protection for both image and storage

OpenStack is a hot project among cloud industry. But it lacks some enterprise level features. If we can enhance OpenStack with EMC products' enterprise-level features, then EMC can have more share on cloud market.
The implementation is that we add some interfaces and drives for communication between OpenStack and Mozy online backup. Then the OpenStack can backup all the images and data in a regular period of time without users' attention. And at the same time, advanced feature of Moze oline backup such as file sync and data shuttle can be leveraged as well.
