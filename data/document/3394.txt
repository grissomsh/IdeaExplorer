Dare to be on Top

Trying to gain knowledge I noticed that competition always makes people work harder.
We have different levels in this game but the twist here is that employees challenge each other for the best/top/expert title. To keep this title you have to make sure you win the challenges sent to you by other employees. This will help EMC to share knowledge around the world and inspire employees to learn more.
