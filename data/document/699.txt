New Hires Training Maps
This is a new training idea that will serve the core licensing team. 
We will be hiring a new team in Utah and they will need to be trained ASAP on all licensing and eServices processes. 
Create training maps detailing how to license each product handled by the core licensing team. This can include screenshots as well to show how each step is done. 
Have one unified training map
will save time and resources 
will get the new hires up and running quickly 
will enhance the quality of our team
will create solid reference
