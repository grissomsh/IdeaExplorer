Interactive SE CLI for VMAX
As a part of CLI commands automation and simplification for E2E Horizon, which can contribute to implementing a configuration on a VMAX with few inputs from user side based on SE CLI wizards, without the need for knowledge of complex and lengthy CLI commands.
Automation of SYMCLI commands through either CLI wizards or Excel Macros is originally needed for big batches of provisioning on VMAX, which saves a lot of time and effort, an Excel Macro prototype is created on https://inside.emc.com/docs/DOC-122839 . So whenever the design SIG is received from the SA during an implementation, the Macro will transform the Layout sheet from the SIG to SYMCLI commands in seconds.
Automated SE CLI wizards that can be as flexible and time consuming as the GUI "Unisphere for VMAX", a lot of these wizards can be inherited from www.reajeshvu.com who already have gone through the development of a lot of these wizards with .html interface. Also thorugh Excel Macros as "Command Automation" which generates SYMCLI commands based on SIG layout input; Command Automation is part of "SIG Automation Tool" found @ https://inside.emc.com/docs/DOC-122839 .
In case of SE CLI Wizards, it would be part of the SE on the mgmt server, with menu-like wizard from which the user can choose what he needs to do and be prompted with required inputs. Or the Excel Macro can simply be a part of a bigger Symmetrix Automation. And of course this can be applied to other Storage systems as VNX and VPLEX.
