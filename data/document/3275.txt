Giveaway Vending machines



I liked giveaways given to employees in different EMC premises which got me thinking why not get the giveaway I’d like to use the most instead of just random things I might not use.


Vending machines is a great way to keep giveaways for employees to pick the ones they like and get to keep instead of wasting them on people that won’t use them. So if I’d like to get an EMC pen or mouse for example I can just use the vending machine with my meal card (paying a small amount of money that can go later to other giveaways). There could be giveaway of the month like limited edition for items that were given to employees in events and there are only few left.
