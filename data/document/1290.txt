UK CS Skills Matrix
Currently UK VSD Resource Management Cairo Team doesnâ€™t have visibility on the engineers skills which consumes time to get back to the DSM to know who can do what.
We are aiming to gather all the CSE engineers skills in one sheet.
Working closely with the technical team in the UK allowed me to identify the deficiencies in the process that wastes time.
It reduced the time taken to identify CSE engineers skills from 3.3 Days to zero Days, original process was to check with management about the skills of their engineers
The created skills matrix will allow everyone to immediately identify the engineers skills in the CS environment
