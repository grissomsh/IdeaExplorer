Workgroup communication APP
Part of PS EMEA transformation plan, is about communication. we still get the ETA and GA emails. yet most of them are not discipline related to where the techs are in. in the meantime the communications are still there in your inbox where you can check them if you want a good read in different WGs or discipline. which would enhance the tech community communications and build more technical development rooms.
I have thought of the same app on a previous year, yet the same challenge I have now as I am not good with graphic design and couldn't deliver the mockups. though I am looking with a colleague from my department who has interests in design who would help me come up with a proposed design, yet the main purpose is to take advantage of the notification feature on smart phones who are enrolled in appwatch to add a new app to help the communication part of the workgroups initiative. 
not everyone notices all communications since there are hundreds of them which are sometimes on irrelevant interest, hence techs might miss the ones that are really valuable and important to their workgroup/discipline or practice or sometimes read them later which may cause inconsistency in delivery or applying the known error resolution or even using the right codes for the relevant products.
Is this idea is implemented, it was ease up a lot of the updates sent out to global services, and would eliminate the fact of missing important communications and Go ahead releases and avoid such missed important info.
