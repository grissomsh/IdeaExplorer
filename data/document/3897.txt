Use separate garbage cans for rubbish in the office's kitchens

Inspired with worldwide practices of sorting waste and EMC ecology initiatives. 
In my opinion, it's not very difficult to put separate garbage cans in the kitchens and organise the required service, but realisation of this idea may change not only the way of rubbish utilisation inside of the office, but also the behavior of employees and their relatives at home. As sorting waste in Russia is not a popular practice, our colleagues may be encouraged to popularise it among their family members and friends, if we have the opportunity to start sorting waste at work.
