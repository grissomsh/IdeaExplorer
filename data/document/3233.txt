Communicator ask a question

I have a question don't know who to ask Fast
Add several groups on communicator that are divided per product and speciality.
So when someone needs to ask a question in a certain product, he sends a message on communicator to the group related to this product. People who are free and have their status on communicator to ("able to answer questions") for example get this message.
If they reply, a conversation is created betweeen the person who initiated the question and the person replying.

We could add a pointing system, every one who answers the question get a point.
This will help in increasing the contibution of the team.
Fast response and higher team building.
