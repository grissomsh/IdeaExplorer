Customer based Analytics platform

-
Some data collected from production environments would be very useful to analyze.
Data like: performance, IOs, Data rates, and more.

If we are able to get the customers approval to install a module at their datacenters to collects some of the metrics they agree to share. 
All those metrics from different customers, being treated confidentially and anonymously, are stored in a cloud solution with high computation power. The data is then analyzed and useful output would be reached.

Researches from universities would also be able to get some data based on which they could do some researches and simulations.
