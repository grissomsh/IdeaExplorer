GS -- Innovation hub!

These thoughts came to mind while thinking more about this challenge.
Fostering creativity
- Have periodic Innovation competitions between small subgroups, and probably build it into a wider one.
- Encourage people to be creative by rewarding meaningfully
- Allocate enough time in their weekly hours to dedicate on doing something creative.
- Have a monthly GS newsletter that captures all the creative events that happened that month across GS and also call out one day-to-day problem in it and ask people to respond with their creative solution to it. Of course, reward the best response!

Cross-functional collaboration
- Internal facebook kind of a platform that is dedicated to GS employees, where they can form dedicated groups based on interests
- Have an internal newsgroup/forum where interesting issues will be posted. Anyone within GS can post a suggestion on how to resolve it. They may have already faced a similar situation/issue else where. Yes, you don't want to keep reinventing the wheel!
- Encourage teams to come up with a fun-creative video that talks about their area of work. This will help teams understand more about each other.

Social contribution
- Most people like to contribute, but, don't have the time or in a position to do so. So, create various simple ways in which people can contribute to a social causes.
- Encourage the contributors org-wide quarterly or half-yearly, thereby inspiring others to do so.
- Make simple videos on why a particular social cause is critical
- Spread the success stories through videos
- Mention social champions on external EMC web site, so that the word will spread thick & fast globally.
- Get them to join & contribute in EMC's Practically green initiative!
