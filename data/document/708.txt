EMC Silo - A crack at expanding our brand to public
Our idea would establish EMC in the public sector that should significantly enhance the brand's visibility & awareness to the masses. 

It provides us with a stage to showcase our exceptional work in various domains to the world. Just because of our absence from the public view, our significant innovations go unobserved as compared to the competitors like Amazon, Google etc.

The Silo is a creative way of attracting diverse crowd to the EMC World.
Today's market space is gradually being taken over by start-ups and small businesses which are making it big such as Airbnb, Uber, Dropbox etc. As a result, major chunk of investments are now skewed towards this space for maximizing their returns. 

After speaking to a number of entrepreneurs, we discovered that our reach is somehow limited to the big businesses and the automatic answer to the cry of startups is rather a public-popular brand Amazon than a silent winner EMC.

Biggest pain point for a start up is an office space which is supported by the fact that 86% of the them across the globe have started out of a coffee shop'  - A constraint which we propose to tap to launch ourselves.
Our idea is simple. Get out there in the market, provide entrepreneurs what they need. 

Instead of investing on huge billboards and hoardings for our products in public (No one can relate to Symmetrics / VMAX hoardings at an airport unless they are us) we need to target the right people first.
Our solution would be the best step to filter the target audience from the thick populations of metropolitan cities. 

After a thorough analysis of how best to tap the startup/public sector - We came up with the concept of introducing EMC Silo 
- a space that will bring like-minded entrepreneurs under one roof
- provide them with the basic infrastructure (high speed internet, excellent data storage potential along with potentially best back up options) that can kick off their ventures. We can utilize existing resources provided by VMWare, Pivotal, EMC Cloud and storage to accomplish this job.
- educate them of the benefits they can draw from using EMC Products for their infrastructural advancements
- showcase why we are #1 in the global storage domain
- publicize the Silo rather than our products at public places  
- Silo's in turn would would speak about EMC and how our products can serve the business needs of start ups
- attract sharp minds to EMC 

Helping them grow would cement a better relationship between EMC and the upcoming market giants. 
Significant benefits could be drawn for us by this move, to list a few:
- Brand Awareness
- First eye at the budding businesses and high chances of acquisitions at market competitive price
- It will ensure a wide diverse foot fall in EMC's hemisphere and assist our recruitment team with fresh talents
- Potential hot spot for organizing buzzing meet ups, hackathon etc.
- Long term - Tie ups with commercial partners
