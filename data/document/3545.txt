 VSAN Tagging â€“ towards a new era of SAN implementations

 The idea came up from studying the SAN networking and the host to storage SAN implementation labs. Comparing between the LAN and san helped formulating the enhancement
 The idea is to include the VSAN tagging concept in the SAN networking technologies to add the following benefits :

1-	Limit the size of each broadcast domain
2-	Improve security
3-	Improve network usage and efficiency
4-	Ease of SAN management
5-	Physical Layer Transparency

The VSAN tagging can be coupled with the existing zoning protocols to add maximum security and efficiency benefits.

The concept can make use of the existing VLAN tagging concept in implementation
