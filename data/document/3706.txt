Electric buses

I came up with the idea because I live in Eygpt which is suffering from a huge pollution problem so I thought of using an environment friendly way of transportation such as electric buses will help in reducing this problem.
EMC should use electric buses as the transportation mean for its employees which will help in reducing the pollution and power consumption. Moreover, it will help reducing costs and improving the quality.
