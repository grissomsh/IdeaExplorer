Small & Medium Businesses R&D Labs
My idea is about delivering new service idea to help the small and medium enterprises (startups) who their work relate to EMC or its partners' field of work and give them an access to EMC infrastructure "EMC's Hybrid Cloud" as a metered service to do their jobs and which they will come up later with new products idea or improve an existing product and introduce the Hybrid cloud service to be used for R&D or engineering labs for non-EMC activity.
I came up the idea by noticing and observing how the IT industry is heading and how many different small and medium businesses have came with ideas that changed the industry and of EMC acquisitions came from a companies mainly were startups and came with great products ideas
My solution is get advantage of the existing infrastructure of EMC to help the Startup companies to use our infrastructure "The EMC's hybrid cloud" and deploys the IT resources and services to help these startups with their R&D or engineering solutions that could lead to create new products or improve our existing products. To able offer the Hybrid cloud as a metered service to each company depending on their amount of work and its results and if there's a company that could struggle we can offer a business consulting service that would help them to get back on track. From the other side we'll benefiting from empowering EMC's Hybrid Cloud and experience the results from implementing the hybrid cloud and the problems that could happen and improve it for better use in the future
If it's implemented it would create a new business idea that would have an impact to how we do business and empower the many people to create the next big thing under EMC umbrella, also it will make EMC more profitable on the long term and help with the process of developing new products or improve new one.
