Solar outdoor lighting offers many advantages to EMC and is cost effective and environment friendly. Unlike traditional outdoor lighting, itâ€™s virtually maintenance free because the batteries require no regular service. Also Solar LED lights allow more flexibility, in addition to on/off schedules; LEDs can be used with dimmers to turn lights down when not in use and motion sensors to turn them off when no one is present. This makes the system even more cost-effective. Another benefit is in the incidence of extreme weather events the ability to continue to shine during brownouts or power outages. This lighting method can also be extended for other lights.
