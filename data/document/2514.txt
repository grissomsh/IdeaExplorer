Improving data replication and migration speed by compressing original data for VNX replication and migration feature.
data amount to replicate or migrate will be reduced after being compressed, it will improve userâ€™s experience especially when there is a large amount of user data.
Data replication and migration is one of the most important functionalities for CTD product
We often need to execute some test cases which will replicate or migrate a large amount of data from local array to a remote array for VNX Rockies cycle testing, but found the data transmitting speed is slow so we have to wait for long time to check and verify the data integrity .

step1: read original data and then sequentially divide them into a series of data block (such as 8M/each block)
step2: put them into a queue and then use a kind of algorithm(such as LZO, Snappy) to compress these data block
step3: replicate data cpmpressed to remote side
step4: uncompress data received at remote side.
The process could be similar to receiving/sending Video/Audio stream online. 

it will definitely improve product performance and improve customer satisfaction.
