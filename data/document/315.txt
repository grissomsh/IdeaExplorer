Trainings Suggestion
This idea will help Employees to select what training to involve in.
The hesitation we face each quarter to enroll in which course.
My solution is to keep the history of all the enrolled courses by the employees in the education website , then using Big data analytic technology can suggest on the employees what probably the next course he will be interested in to enroll at.

This idea is the same as implemented in Amazon website, that they collect and keep that data of customers who bought a certain product and what was other products he bought.Using this information if another customer bought the same product they suggest on him other products that the other customer bought.
will help the Employees to select the relevant training according to their interest.
