Replace or remove MAPI in the Avamar Exchange Granular Recovery Process 
Improves the solution for doing Granular level recoveries of Exchange data, also improves customer service.
There are a lot of cases generated daily just for Avamar Exchange GLR issues. We depend on 3rd party product MAPI which has a lot of issues. These type of cases usually take a long time to resolve.
Already we use workarounds when Exchange GLR does not work, like use of Exchange  PowerShell to perform the restores. So make PowerShell the standard tool for performing the GLR operation.
Replacing MAPI during GLR process would greatly benefit customers and better CSAT scores. Would also remove a lot of work on EMC side (support, QA and development).
