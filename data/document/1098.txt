A mobile app for product health check
The customer administrators can get the product health and working status easily just with a mobile app
when I want to check the system working status in vacation days or weekend or at night, I need to login from PC, it's not convenient. 
The mobile app got information by executing CLI command and then show it in GUI, the working theory are similar with Unisphere.
It can give customers more convenience and can let them found system issues at the first time.
