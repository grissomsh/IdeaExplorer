Community Team Work
We need to create a portal which would host all the CSR activities. A permanent CSR spoc leading the portal and accepting registration and managing and co-ordinating with the NGO's is required.
We use to carry this activity in Goldman Sachs where in every quarter min of 2 projects were attended per employee
More employees will register and the projects will be tracked "for example: 15-20 registers for Ashwini Child Care for education" day activity. This will give more value add from CSR perspective 
Every employee could contribute with at least registering to min of 2 projects
