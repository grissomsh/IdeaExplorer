Sponsor a monthly EMC Talks Series
Increase diversity by allowing employees to share their experiences and ideas with the EMC community.
I listen to Ted Talks all the time and really appreciate the format and content delivered. EMC is the employer of some very unique individuals and the EMC community would benefit from hearing their stories.
Solicit employees to submit content for their very own Ted Talk.  Topics can be on anything of importance to the individual and should be limited to under 25 minutes.  Panel will review and select the monthly speakers. Talks will be held in person and recorded and shared on InsideEMC.
I think this will really help connect employees to each other and could serve as a catalyst for idea generation.
