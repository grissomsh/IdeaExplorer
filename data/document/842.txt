SECaaS for IoT
This idea provides cloud security services for IoT devices allowing incorporation of security features into devices at device creation time.
New for this challenge
Create Security as a Services (SECaaS) providing solutions to the above problems.
securely.

1. The cloud service has the compute and storage capacity to establish behavioral profiles and a cloud service has visibility to many devices and can establish "normal" behavior of similar devices.
2. The cloud service uses analytics to provide on-going, always updated device reputation
3. The cloud service provides advanced security services such as encryption, secure key management and key rotation and removes this burden from the device creators.
4. The cloud service provides a holistic view of incidents for the customer if the devices he owns uses the RSA SECaaS.
5. The cloud service constantly gets updated.
This idea allows IoT devices to do social networking, eCommerce, etc. by storing sensitive data.
It would be a cloud service operated by RSA.
The APIs would be used by IoT manufacturers as a feature for enterprise customers.
Enterprise customers will enable the security features by purchasing a subscription directly from RSA and get access to the incidents dashboard.
