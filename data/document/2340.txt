Revenue growth by saving power. Shutting down machines while leaving office.
na
Idea came to me as i see around me people leaving their workstations ON while they leave for vacation or next 2 days being off. In fact they leave it ON everyday even after leaving the office.
As of today we see lot of machines are left ON without shutting down and employee would be out of office on a weekend or a vacation however the machine would be still ON and consumes power which could be saved by following simple step. This idea could also save lot of money which would in turn be a revenue savings for the organization.
If the idea is implemented there could be very well cost savings.
