Big Data/Cloud Animation Movie Project Contest

The idea was generated from my personal experience. While trying to explain a concept to a young child, I tend to understand it even better. So in order to allow students to learn more about the 3rd platform we need to embrace fun and creativity with the learning process.
Contest Topic:
Design and implement an animation movie that you would use to explain Big Data or Cloud concepts to a 6 years old student.

Your task is to research, understand and simplify big data or cloud concepts to be able to deliver those findings to a young learner though a simple 7 to 8 minutes animation movie.

The winning movie will be the one with the most accurate information delivered in the simplest way. “If you can't explain it to a six year old, you don't understand it yourself.” ? Albert Einstein

Contest Structure:
Duration: 5 weeks
Groups: 4 to 5 students per group
Condition: Each group will select his topic (big data or cloud) during the first day of the competition.

The contest will be divided into 3 main challenges/phases:

Challenge 1 (2.5 weeks): Research “What do you know about Big Data/Cloud?”
Challenge 2 (1.5 week): Simplify concepts and findings
Challenge 3 (1 week): Create an animation movie to show and deliver your findings


Benefits of this contest include:
1- Students will fully understand the concepts of big data and cloud.
2- Use their outcomes to teach even younger students those same concepts.
