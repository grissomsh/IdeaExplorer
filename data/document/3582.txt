 EMC – The Big Picture

 The idea came in when we saw that employees perform better when they visualize what value they are adding to EMC by doing their daily tasks. We was thinking of generalizing this to the whole EMC environment.
 The idea is to make a video that shows this “EMC process lifecycle”. This video will include flow charts to help illustrate the content. The video will be included in the training path for EMC employees and new hires.

A flow chart big picture can be hung also in COE posters areas (on walls) to raise awareness of all employees
