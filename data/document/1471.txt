The Idea is for each home to have its own minature Data center, with complete virtualization of all the resources…this includes CPU power, storage capacitys, RAM space,…To start doing this; all the resources need to be collected together, with all the needs of the home, and we would have an app per user, for him/her to specify the exact of resources required, that way each member would be allocated efficiently the right amount of resources by having them logon to virtual machines.
To implement this all the products need to be miniaturized, to a very small scale, but still providing the same functionality of our regular products. 
Benefits:
-Cost Saving
-Power Saving
-Saving Resources
-EMC tackling a much bigger market than everyone else, the normal regular user
-Being able to implement our products on smaller scales, this approaching the small businesses strongly
