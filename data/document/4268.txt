EMC Museum 

Innovation Session
The Idea is to have an EMC Museum where EMC would keep the oldest till the newest of its products on display with demos and even a kid's area with EMC games and all. This would be a fun activity for people to go and visit and get familiar with EMC and what it does in a fun and interactive way. Also it would be a nice show to display where EMC started with its products and where it is now.
