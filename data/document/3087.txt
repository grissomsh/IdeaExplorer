Encourage Working Mother Culture for Woman@EMC
N/A
This is my personal experience. My Wife and me are EMC employees working in Shifts. We have a ~3yrs daughter. Work life Balance was difficult. There was a point where my wife was ready to quit and wanted to choose family over work. But, I wanted her to continue and help. Nothing much I could do without enough support system. This Idea Struck me and wanted to take this forward
Update existing policies (periodically), Paid maternity leave (increase duration), Flexible working hours post maternity, Work from Home policy (specially for Mothers working in shifts), create enough opportunities within company or create an environment to continue work
Working Mothers can benefit company in may ways. Inspiration, Growth, Create success stories, Community service etc..
