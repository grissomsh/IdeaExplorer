Automate lab testing environment setup by using ViPR and EHC
E-Lab is doing system compatibility testing, which require a lot of manual setup with various arrays/switches/servers. Leverage EMC Enterprise Hybrid Cloud, can automate some of our manual setup steps, to help improve work efficiency. And also, bring testing into EHC, can change E-lab traditional way of testing to be more cloud-oriented, and help to develop/test/improve use cases that is more suitable to 3rd platform requirements
Came out with this idea after took VIPR training, and was discussion about how to improve Recoverpoint testing efficiency within the team
- There were some previous attempt to automate elab testing, but normally, these involved different tools to separately automate works on switch/array/servers. Now doing this on ECH, especially with ViPR, all the automation can be done on the cloud itself

- We can achieve also resource tracking with our systems in cloud. Which help to see our test cycle, manage our test resource, generate reports more easily
- Improve team work efficiency
- Help to tailor Elab testing scope to be more 3rd platform oriented
