EMC Online Manufacturing Guide
*
Collaboration between Mike O'Regan and Marta Bodenko
We propose the creation of an EMC Online Manufacturing Guide with support for advanced navigation features such as expandable sections, a breadcrumb trail, related-topic links, and mini Tables of Content and images, audio and video.

This guide would provide procedures and reference materials required for the physical build of all EMC products. 

It would support all system configurations, organized by the main physical build processes: assembly, cabling, pre- and post-test process, and final preparation for shipment. 

Available cross platform â€“ phone, tablet, laptop, electronic white board.

For example a section for installing a VNX DAE would explain the task, highlight safety concerns and then step through the process with diagrams, photos and highlighted torque settings.

All tools and parts required would be listed and photographs included
