Canteen News Promotion
This idea matches collaboration, communication, workplace 2.0 and it can be used to upskill employees. It enables employees to easily and conveniently receive information at their leisure about upcoming events that may affect them, for example, the soccer tournament, the Summer BBQ and other less known events.
Missing out on events due to lack of knowledge
Brainstorming session
Mount television screens visibly in the canteen. These screens will display any upcoming events that are being held locally and effectively inform the workforce about them. Only a few queuing areas in the canteen and coffee docks with brief updates/snippets of information are needed. This will both increase awareness and popularity of events being held. The information being displayed on each screen could be updated daily by a designated canteen employee. There could also be an area with updates from all the EMC Federation sites in Ireland - what we're doing in the community, who is visiting, special offers etc.
This idea can be implemented easily and quickly. Employees will benefit from EMC's wide variety of services as they stay fully informed. TVs will provide a great platform for communicating where the vast majority of the workforce regularly congregate. Show the stuff at the queues and that'll spark conversations during lunch. A x-functional team can come together to collaborate on the content and how it will be delivered. Will deliver a modern look/ feel to the workplace. Employees will acquire new skills as they learn how to update the information on the television.
