Control case time

I had this idea while being asked why some cases were open for too long.
If we had this functionality already working we could easily see where times was going.


This idea would work by using the "Status" field we can control how many days we wait for someone action.
That time would be count and presented in "History tab" so managers can see which actions are taking more time to be completed, waiting customer answer , waiting TSE,etc.
Having this information we can have a general idea of case time and in long term we can have a customers historical time . Here we can control if usually customer takes more time to answer to our communication or actions requested.
We could improve all processes involved in case resolution by using the time which group is taking to provide a new action.
