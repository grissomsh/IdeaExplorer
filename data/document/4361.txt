Interflush Water-saving Product

saw it on an ad and I think it's a good idea for saving water at work
The Interflush Water-saving Product is A kit which fits on top of your WC siphon and connects to the front mounted flush handle. Only flushes when the handle is held down, releasing the handle stops the flush (when pan is clear). Only uses just what water is needed. Any less and the toilet would need flushing again.
