Backup and Restore between Isilon and VNX File

Shortly after Isilon was acquired by EMC.
Isilon already understands the VNX NDMP data format as part of the isi_vol_copy_vnx data migration functionality.  Enabling VNX/VMAX File NDMP backups would require reusing that knowledge/code in the NDMP restore code of OneFS.   
The VNX/VMAX File NDMP code could also be enhanced to understand the Isilon NDMP data format.  Code that does this already exists in both Isilon and CTA.
