Solution support Model

- Redesigning/Streamlining of the solution support model we have
- We are starting Solution support model in CS
- The only thing I want to add is that there should be a structured way for this program and criteria set to measure the efficiency of this program 

Few suggestion which I have is : - 

- Along with brown bag session there should be exchange of Engineers between teams so that they can work closely and have hands on experience on the product

- Engineer should be taken out of production from his team;s business so that he can focus on what he is learning and make use of the program
