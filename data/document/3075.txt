Heatmap Analysis of Feature Test Coverage in System (End-to-End) Test
I didn't see a focal Challenge for my idea. It could easily apply to several - CTD Supportability in 12 Months or Less; TCE Challenge, others. It could apply to any test group, BU or other agency having lots of data that just needs to be mined and/or tagg
I created this idea late in 2014, but implemented it in CTD Systems Test, to solve a long-standing challenge (previously unbeknownst to me). Originally, the data mining solution seemed interesting to me at first, only to determine which group did what type of testing, used what type of tools, etc. This was refined by my group's director, who directed me to think about data mining info about features that were shipping.
Mine is a mining solution that mines test info by feature and tags it to the group conducting the testing. Most test databases group test info by group, cycle, release, product. If so, then the data can be tagged and searched (by a frequency of occurrence algorithm) to determine a heatmap of feature test coverage by test group. The features of interest can be characterized by search terms (words, numbers, alphanumerics). Then, you could relate the features to test coverage by analyzing the test terms. I've used a home-grown script to create heatmaps for system testing of several releases, cycles and features of interest.
A direct benefit would be knowledge of what constitutes the most risk in a shipping product. In other words, you should be able to characterize where the most risk lies among the various shipping features in a release - whether a major, minor release or a
