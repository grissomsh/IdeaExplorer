Common problem faced by customers for contacting support

•	No direct option to contact support.
o	Customer has to search the web page
o	No Mobile app for live chat 
•	Time taken to contact support team takes longer period. 
o	Time taken for contacting appropriate support teams consumes more amount of time.
o	Due to this the resolution of the problem also takes longer period.
•	Complex tasks
o	Customer has to search through different option to contact support. 
o	Customer has to raise SR ticket and wait for support team to reply.
o	More complex settings in the currently available Live chat mechanism.
The proposed solution is addressing the customer problems when contacting the appropriate support team. The implementation of proposed idea also enables the customer to contact support team in much easier way. The idea proposes to build a new chat messenger (web application and mobile application) with menu driven option; hence customer can easily select the product from options and get access to the correct support team in single select operation.
This web app/mobile app will provide customer to interact with EMC support quickly and efficiently. It will be like a chat messenger between the customers and the concerned support team. The proposed solution will not only act as messenger, it will also as smart application where customer can check the SR status, search product article and etc.
