Analytics on Customer storage data for proactive support
NA
it has been observed that we don't have any centralized portal that has access to customer to see all his products well structured and recommendations for the mishaps on their boxes.
Pull out the data from storage's and analyse the same, publish the results analyzed.
Which should include best practices that are missing, optimization suggestion etc.
There can be some recommendations that can bring us business, some can be used to gain confidence in customer so that he comes back to us; 
Even the data polled out of the storages world wide can help us test our new Hadoop products, DWH capable stuff
