Storage array hinting

Just though of it during the lunch.
We suggest to hint the storage about the workload pattern that is about to hit the storage. This way the storage array could perform needed adjustments.
The hinted workload patterns are:
•	Sequential read 
The use cases are:
o	VMware vSphere® High Availability (HA) feature. When a site \ server outage is detected, it restarts the VMs on other vSphere hosts. This will results in massive sequential read.
o	Backups - reading the data from the production site will results in massive sequential read.
o	Storage VMotion - reading the data from the source site will result in massive sequential read.
o	
•	Sequential write
The use cases are:
o	Backups - writing the data to the remote site will results in massive sequential write.
o	Storage VMotion - writing the data to the destination site will result in massive sequential write.
•	Random read
•	Random write
•	Unknown
This is a standard mode, in which the pattern is unknown.

Inter alia, this will reduce backup and RTO times, since the storage will operate faster in these scenarios.
