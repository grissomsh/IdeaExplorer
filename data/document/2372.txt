Web-based EMC solution learning and simulation tool (EMC Internal)
We have several products on different technology.
Today's market is on solutions not on proprietary product. Solution engineer heeds to know how to use proprietary products to derive solution which can be sold by company instead or product.
We have several products, but it is tough to know each every product's "How it works" theoretically and derive solutions by combining all of them.
The tool will have simulation for all EMC products. A person who has knowledge on technology can login there and virtually use different EMC products to derive a solution. Or engineer can simulate a customer problem to prepare solution for that. This tool will help engineer to create solution by effectively use all EMC products and it will give a heads-up if we are missing any connecting product in our portfolio to prepare a solution.
It will help all engineer (who is aware or technology) to be aware of each and every EMC products and way how to use them to derive a complete solution.
