RSA Software

I asked the IT once for a RSA token soft copy & they told me you have to give back your hard copy first before getting a soft copy, But I cant have both.

So why not have the soft copy in the first place, & eliminate the costs of hard copies.
Install Soft copy RSA Tokens on All Laptops , Like the communicator, Cisco phones & every other Software copy
