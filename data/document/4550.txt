Data Analysis on Customer Environment 

- Idea came up because we'd like to utilize the bug data approach to help our Customers about the repeated issues from certain components or product.

- Deliver a solution to the customer without his request to make him satisfied all the time and in safe hands.  
- Collecting the data about the Customer Infrastructure and Store it at Big Data Solution.

- Monitoring all SRs and issues for all products and save this data on the Big Data Solution.

- Prepare a report and use Data Analysis Approach to know which component is the cause for the big problem or what is the way to enhance that in the future.

- We can provide with a solution to this customer to avoid multiple issues in the future and he will show the evidence by showing the reports about the case.

- Customer Environment will be Monteverdi and making analysis all the time to get the maximum performance.
