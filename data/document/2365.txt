VNX  voice messages to customer 
new feature for EMC  customers 
Just now when i remembered the robot in interstellar movie  
introducing a new feature in VNX to have an option to inform the customer about the alert of error done not only by sending a DH or an event log but also via voice msg when customer use this feature he can listen to his issues and also listen to the action plan 
will have a customer more satisfaction and it is a newly feature not any body or any other product can think to make it ... creative idea
