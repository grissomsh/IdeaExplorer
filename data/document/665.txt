Getting things done
N/A
We came up with this idea while observing  employees complaining of not having a work-life balance and work load while they waste a lot of time.
This idea was implemented at my past job and I saw the difference, time wasted was very little and targets were usually achieved on time without having to work extra hours.
Our idea is about helping employees to control time waste throughout the day by developing a schedule in which they can plan breaks and not to exceed an hour (Whatever agreed with supervisor or team lead)
This will help employee make the best use of working hours which helps at achieving targets/tasks/goals which will make a great difference in business units.
Supervisors will be able the to track how employees manage their time which will help at evaluating their performance fairly.
Best employee could be rewarded monthly as the "Most Punctual Employee of The Month" to motivate employees to improve their time management skills.
This will help employee make the best use of working hours which helps at achieving targets/tasks/goals which will make a great difference in business units.
