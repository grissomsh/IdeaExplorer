GS AroundMe

I came up with this idea during my last business trip in Rome and was thinking if I can find my GS colleagues around by just one click.
GS AroundMe is a mobile application that will help GS employees to find each other geographically around the world.

By scanning the location will show you the closest colleague around you and gives the chance to chat and meet by just one click.

Think of GS employee in a business trip in Brazil and he/she is lost or needs any kind of assistance; using GS AroundMe will help to find a GS colleague who can offer the assistance needed.
On a local level, its always nice to meet a colleague for the first time in a restaurant while both are working in the same business unit for some time but didnâ€™t meet before.

P.S. Every employee will have the option to disable (When needed) the location service for privacy reasons.
