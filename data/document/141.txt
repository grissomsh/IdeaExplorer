Improve the experience of using EMC 3rd platform products - PCF
It helps with provide a path for using EMC 3rd platform products against using AWS or Openshift for Application deployment.


I had good knowledge on AWS. But when I started to looking at PCF, I searched material on how AWS architecture compares to PCF architecture. But couldn't find any relevant material.

For example:- PCF containers vs Amazon VMs requirement is a big difference.
AWS doesn't have multiple docker container deployment and management on same VM etc...

Write an article and provide a sample application for architecting/migrating the apps deployed in AWS and Openshift architecture to PCF. Make a Strong case for Cloud Foundry in terms of cost, ease of deployment, private cloud deployment, and scaling.

Also provide sample app for showcasing ease of deployment on cloud foundry.
Attracts developers focused on other clouds like aws and openshift. Improves the productivity of the developers with knowledge in other clouds and new to cloud foundry.
