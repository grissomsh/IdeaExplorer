Image to Document Tool
Increase in efficiency and reduce time wasted
Customers with multiple requests tend to send a screen shot that consolidates all details together. I waste some time to translate details from the screen shot to actual editable/usable text.
The idea is to have a tool that converts the image of text to an editable text file.
This will facilitate e-mail communication.

The tool should be able to convert any image to an editable version of a document.
This can include but not limited to:
- Text
- Contact Cards
- Array Cables and General Images
- Tables
- Charts
This tool will save time and increase efficiency and at the end, decrease CS engineers' TTR
