My Employee Happy Employee
Most of our employees work far away from their home ( parents , brother ) and those who are married fight the cost of living in huge cities where EMC is located.

My Idea is that EMC provides a home ( let it be just a 1BHK ( bedroom, hall, kitchen )on Lease to us. Most of us would just start their work life and would have no money . EMC somehow provide them home and take the lease money as EMI's ( monthly Installments ) from us.
Personal experiences
Seeing how many employees suffer in new cities.
Considering women employee safety
Solution is that EMC must kindly look into this option . look into the scenario of its employees and must provide such basic facilities.

When EMC thinks about Car lease program then this House lease program must be considered.

A home for an employee makes sense then a car.
The tag of best place to work will remain and probably a needy employee would say Best place to Work and Best place to live.. 

When one of our Employee is satisfied then we all know the results very clearly.
