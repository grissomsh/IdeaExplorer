Integration of Pivotal Cloud Foundry to Graph DB
This Idea is related to Integrating Pivotal Cloud Foundry with Graph DB for the Analysis of the Logs
While we were working with PCF for the project, we discovered that this idea would bridge the 2nd platform and 3rd platform transition.
Logs are very important part in the Application which provides information on the Application health and performance.

In Micro Service Architecture we have Micro Services,every micro service will give its own Log information.

We have to Integrate Pivotal Cloud Foundary with Graph DB like Neo4j.

By Using Graph DB like Neo4J we can tag individual nodes with Individual Services which in turns gives Logs respective to Individual Nodes.

We are basically Filtering Logs from one big monolithic files to small chunks of Logs for individual services or nodes.

The Logs which we get can easily tracked for any issue/Exception or the searching of the service will become easy.

The Logs which we get from this Nodes can be streamed into some Log Analytic system,to find out which service is frequently throwing error.

It is very easy to represent  Log with connected data.

It is very easy and faster to retrieve/traversal/navigation of more Connected Logs.

It represents semi-structured data very easily.

The Logs will be well organised now.


The following are the benefits
-Its easy to track the logs
-We can store this Log and do Analytics about which services is working or Giving error.
-Saves time for Developers to track the issue
