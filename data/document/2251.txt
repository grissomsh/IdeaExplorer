SMART HR INVITING Process tool 
Currently when we raise a invitation request using a very user friendly tool https://emeahrssc.corp.emc.com/ we get a mail stating request raised.
But we are not sure from how long its in same state what has to be done by us.


I had raised an Inviting letter from a USA manager, HR guys works from evening 5pm to night IST and USA manager works 10pm to morning IST. Whenever i needed to track both of them it was really hard for me to get in sync with them.
Instead of manually running around and following with HR and inviting manager, we can put up a reminder mail notification to all respective once every 12 hours about the status of the thread still its closed.
Also in the same portal where we submit the request we can keep track of the logs what is happening on the request.
It will make everybody life easy and maintain clarity of the whole process of it.
