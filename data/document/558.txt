EMC support application
save time for customers to open SRs for small queries
lots of cases are opened for just a small question and customer get frustrated for not having them solved quickly
an application for customer to enter and write the query they have, application should be linked to salesforce articles and once customer wrote a question all relevant articles would appear for customer to help him and TSE should have access on cases created to help customers through their queries.
it will improve the customer experience with support received from EMC
