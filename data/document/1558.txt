TED becomes more and more popular. A lot of scientists, artists, and ordinary people have shared their ideas through the platform, and make the world to hear their voices, and know their names. We can copy the pattern to EMC. That's where the idea come from
It needs to build up a platform to do that.
This platform is a browser based application, and employee of EMC can visit the platform either outside or inside EMC offices via their employee ids/NT accounts.
On this platform, people can make a video to record some talks - food, festival, technology, views to the world, environmental protection, etc. Then they can upload the video and PPT to the platform. After filling in the category, title of the video and some necessary information, they can publish it and everyone in EMC can watch it. 
When people login to the platform, they can navigate/search the topics/categories of videos they are interested. They can add their comment, score to the video (like - 1-5 stars).
HR or some specific people can view those videos with the highest scores, and decide whether to invite the authors of the videos to present lively. For some extraodinary topics, HR can invite the authors to process a lecture circuit on all sites of EMC.
