VMs for Employees to be used for Business continuity 
This idea will guarantee Business continuity and customer satisfaction.
The idea came up from Network speed latency so that this solution can provide us to be on a different network that has a higher speed so that we can maintain the same workload and performance. 
The idea will guarantee business continuity by installing a pool of Virtual Machines that can be accessed remotely that has all the tools we use installed on it,These VMs can be allocated in different GEOs. 
This can be implemented using Desktop Visualization instead of Remote Desktop connection so that every employee can make full utilization of the computing power.    
1. Guarantee Business Continuity.
2.Improve Customer Satisfaction.
3.Having Redundant machines with all our tools installed for disaster recovery.
