I was recently on a work trip abroad and was unaware that almost all public parking spaces in the country where I was were not for free. This was when I first had this idea. 
The idea is simply to provide new rental car drivers with brief information on the local traffic rules in the country where they are driving. As an example, the following info can be of value to foreign drivers: local speed limits, traffic lights and road signs info, common causes of accidents, most common causes of getting a fine, parking spaces and parking cost. This info can be presented through the built-in screens that some cars now have or on through a mobile app that the person renting the car can install. 
This can benefit the public by contributing to having safer roads. It can also be used by car rental companies as a competitive advantage. For EMC, this can be beneficial by creating an opportunity for selling storage products and cloud computing services
