Reduce CO2 Emissionsâ€™ Science project contest

This idea was generated from the fact that media is recently focusing on globa warming and reducing CO2 emission rates to perserve our planet.  
Topic Summary: 
Demonstrate through a prototype one way that would help the world reduce the CO2 emissions.
The prototype should be built from environmentally friendly product. You should be able to explain how your prototype will reduce CO2 emissions using scientific facts. 

Contest Duration: 2 months 
Groups: Each group can have 3-4 students

Contest Description: 
The contest will be divided into 3 phases and after each phase a progress draft should be submitted with phase summary and phase outcome.

1-Phase1 "Problem Definition": (1.5 week)
Formulation of a clear problem definition and ideas brainstorming sessions. 
Durig this phase students should be able to understand the problem and generate as much ideas as possible.


2-Phase2 "Research & Testing": (3.5 weeks) 
Work on refining the concepts, research, constructing hypothesis and early phases of experimenting validity of hypothese.
During this phase students should start researching and gathering as much info as possible to have a solid base to start their work. They should construct their own hypotheses and test it.


3-Phase3 "Implentation & Conclusion": (3 weeks) 
Work on implementing the prototype, troubleshooting, analysis and conclusion.
During this phase students should be able to construct their prototype and start the troublehsooting process. They should be able to analyze and validate their hypothese and defend their final outcome.

Hints: 
A- The prototype can be a process, a product or a simulation tool.
B- Some sources of CO2 emissions include:

   1- Burning of fossil fuels
   2- Heating homes
   3- Burning garbage
   4- Road Transport
