Using knowledge on how data is structured to improve compression in XtremIO or VNX
This solution relates to XtremIo and DSA, both in Israeli COE.

The idea is coming from my past experience in DSA (Formerly DBC) and thinking how could we use monitored data gathered from monitoring tools in today's storage arrays

The idea is to use data collected from a monitoring tool like DSA (Other tools can be used as well) in order to identify how to better compress tables.
Then build a mapping mechanism from table to blocks and transfer this data to the XtremIO box.

The types of knowledge that can be identified:
1. Access patterns that suggest defining a compression unit larger than a single block (e.g. table is being accessed using full table scan can have larger compression units)

2. Data patterns to improve compression
(e.g. tables with repeating text fields can use this knowledge for better compression
Identifying table contains only numbers, only text etc. can also provide better compression)

3. Identify data not to be compressed using data type
(e.g. BLOBs may not require compression if they hold pictures)

4. Identify data not to be compressed using compression ratio of similar data
XtremIO can receive logical structures (e.g. Tables) and identify that these tables were not properly compressed, all future data added to this table will not be compressed at all
Better usage of knowledge in data will provide better compression and better usage of compressed data
Improved performance by not attempting to compress data which will not benefit from compression
