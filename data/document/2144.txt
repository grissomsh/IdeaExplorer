PHASER (Patient History Archiving System with Electronic Recovery)
Well my idea is simply applying archiving and recovery within the smart city, but in a beneficial way and impact on mainly health problems in Egypt.
I believe that as much people and problems we have in this country, the most important concern is healthcare in a technological way that would make it really efficient.
I came up with this idea two years ago in my software project at the college, and I also had 3 more colleagues in the team.
We have an implemented interface with the NFC card and a database (small example).

1- Having a well-documented database will help a lot of doctors who face big problems in  
   preparing their medical researches and studies in Egypt.

2- Engaging an NFC ship to our national ID so whenever it's scanned we get accurate 
   information on patient history and here are examples where it could be used:

    a) On a first appointment with a doctor that would have access from the ministry of   
       health for example on the system, that would avoid misdiagnosing or prescribed   
       wrong treatment plans.
    b) When accidents occur and we have a patient lying down the road, you can easily 
       scan his id on the system installed on the ambulance.
    c) The doctor could save the prescriptions on the patient profile, so there would be 
       more control on drugs from pharmacies side.

This is actually more related to the Egypt COE smart city and IoT challenge.

I believe this idea would enhance productivity, optimize the process of healthcare  well documentation and decrease misdiagnosed cases in Egypt. (which affected a lot of Egyptians throughout the previous years)
