Networker Resource Edit Automation
This will help to automate the multiple tasks in one step with different networker resources
Whenever we do projects many times we require multiple resources to be added, modified or decommissioned. Based on our experience we realized a need to have an automatic way to do all these tasks which also eliminates human errors.
The idea behind this script is to automate multiple tasks which any networker admin has to do in day to day life which takes huge amount of time. 
Me and few of my colleagues worked together to build that partial script and we did tested successfully with in the Lab.
