The Lab BUDDY

I attended many courses and each course is the same for different students.
A tool that modifies the lab experience to each student weaknesses is the one that will make any Lab different
The tool must be generic and then each course will have a set of goals to achieve them through giving hints and correcting the errors of the student Then stressing on these errors in the next Lab.
The SMART Buddy can adjust the weights on each goal according to each student.
