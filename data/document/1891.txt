End-of-Day Notification
Following the IT Value of Respect, creating more awareness of time zone differences, and when peoples work day has ended would be helpful.
IT Values made me think about this.
If the alert could be trigger when the user logs off the Corp Network for example. the user should also be given the choice to turn on/off this notification. 
greater respect for our global colleagues.
