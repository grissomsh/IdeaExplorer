Open Source 3rd Platform STEM Education Community Quorum App @EMC
Below solution is proposed for UTAH COE challenge, for developing an end to end Open Source application that can be used for communication between Schools, EMC employees & external partners for any queries related to STEM Education at EMC. 
Quora is an awesome question & answer web site ( https://www.quora.com ) used by developers across the world. Functionalities suggested for the new App above is a result of using Quora. 

Also we are a 3rd platform Open Source Application development team ( primarily using Spring framework ) in IT, having experience working with end to end application development & experience with microservices on Pivotal Cloud Foundry.

Benefits 
The App can be scaled to support EMC Community Involvement in other Geographic locations as well, other than Utah. 
Proposal is to have a scalable role based Open Source Web Application built using 3rd platform microservices architecture. 

Functionally the App will be able to perform the below activities,

-	User will be able to register to the App 
-	At the time of registry, User will be asked to choose his/her preferred topic 
-	Any User will be able to post a question and tag a specific topic to the question
-	Notification will be sent to the Users when a question is posted, based on their preferred topics 
-	One or more notified Users can reply back to the forum with their inputs.
-	Users will have the option to attach any documents required while posting or replying back
-	App will be designed role based to have Admins that can provision/approve access for teachers from respective schools.
-	Track time spent on the website for EMC employees to report on EMC Give Back days

Integrations with other Applications 

-	System can be customized to consume & search Inside EMC profiles for sending notifications for related questions.
-	Can be built to consume any web services provided by external systems (like VeX Robotics)
-	Can be integrated with SSO for EMC employees ( similar to other EMC apps )
-	Can be built to track the distribution kits for Schools ( based on the requirements )

The proposed technology stack involves developing a 3rd platform compatible, responsive web application with below components.
-	Responsive bootstrap UI for cross device compatibility ( use in both laptop & mobile devices ) & Jquery for front end development ( along with HTML, CSS, Ajax )
-	Use REST API backend development using Spring MVC & develop App using 3rd platform microservices architecture using PCF
-	My SQL for database
-              The App  can be hosted on IT Pivotal Cloud Foundry instance for speedy deployments & maintenance.

MockUps are available at https://inside.emc.com/docs/DOC-156190 

The team has Open Source reusable components that can be leveraged for developing this App for Utah.
Employees spend a lot of time in Community Activities, providing a platform makes it measurable & help us improve any process gaps, at the same time benefits the school community looking forward to connect with EMC & learn about our technologies.
