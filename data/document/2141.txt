Insta EMC
The challenge is Community Involvement Challenge which main concern is how to allow to reduce the gap between all EMC employees worldwide through cultural exchange between employees  and my idea is targeting the same concern on how people get to know each other better and spread their cultures all around the company branches.
There's no history of the idea, it's inspired from the application Instagram but EMC customized.
So, what if offering a mobile app which is feasible for everybody to use.it’s the same idea as Instagram but EMC customized, where all the employees will have this application and through it they could upload their photos and share it with other employees they could share their different moments at EMC.
That’s would greatly help exchanging the cultural difference between employees coming from different countries as well as sharing their different traditions and customs which would greatly reduce the gap.
Also, they could upload and share a video for about only 1 minute where they could share a word, information or any short message they want to deliver. And, by that way people could get more engaged and communicated together much better.

The idea would be an application accessible for each employee at EMC, it's main aim is to connect people more, make them engage better, share their different moments together and by that way we will be able to let all employees across EMC communicate better and exchange their cultural differences.
if the idea worked and this app really launched I think it will be one of the most popular applications across all EMC branches, specially the social media idea is taking a large impact in our everyday life.
