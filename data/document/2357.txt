customization or any new implementation updates from PS to support team 
We have many such cases where our investigation takes way to long to get into the details of the customization's done in customer's env. when customer raise's an SR they think that we are all aware of the changes done by pur PS team but unfortunately we are not also it gets very difficult to get all the details of the changes made in customer's env and the investigations take a  very long time.  if we have these details, we can easily assist to customer without wasting time. Because we will be having these details and we can easily conclude the issue and provide resolution faster.
Example I had a customer , where in he did some modification with the help of PS team. after couple of weeks he will face some issue and raise an SR with support. Support will not have any idea and start initial troubleshooting.. after couple of days support will not get any outcome after performing initial troubleshooting. When we go back to engineering and when they will do WebEx with customer and they will identify the issue is related to modification and then they will start looking into that, I have faced this issue multiple times with all the product and to avoid these delays we should have all the details.
I think we can have a doc or a share where in the PS can upload or share the info of the changes done to the particular customer and we can any time browse the share and get all the details without any waste of time and can conclude and provide the resolution faster 
Yes after dealing with one such customer I created a Cc share and updated my team about the customization happened and when customer raised Sr's after that we had enough information about his env for investigation
