Secure Cloud-based Individual-Level Mobile Service to Protect Personal Data of High Profile Customers.
Storing Personal Information has become crucial specifically for high profile celebrities, top executives, and politicians. This idea utilizes the concept of bringing out security to our most valuable possessions, "our personal information footprint."  
The idea has been in my mind ever since all the global media outlets were discussing the hacking scandals seeking an answer. No effective solution targeting this issue in specific has been released or introduced yet, and for that I believe that this will be an incredible opportunity for EMC to leave a fingerprint on that part of the market.
The idea is mainly about introducing a new EMC solution that would integrate security and cloud services and make them accessible from an individual-level terminal; mainly cellphones and personal tablets. The user would synchronize the service with their personal devices to store and backup all of their data while protecting them from being spoofed or acquired by unauthorized entities. 

The service will immensely capitalize on the federation's reputation for being a renowned name in the world of storage and security. 

It wouldn't be a free service, as it will be offering exceptional measures of protection  to exceptional people, yet it will have the simplest and easiest interface at the same time to brand the idea of on-demand exclusive data protection. It will require a smart marketing plan to address the right target audience.
The idea won't need a lot of financial investment given that we've already got the resources and the technology needed. The return on investment (ROI) could be significant. It will showcase and brand EMC's capabilities within an individual-level.
