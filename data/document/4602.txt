Colored EMC products.

Most consumer products come in various colors, why not enterprise products be colored, specially when there are benefits in coloring the products.
Why not have an option of White bezel for our VMAX VNX etc. When ever I enter a data center, all I see is racks and racks of dull dark colors, which looks pretty boring. Today almost all the cell phone manufacturers have options of different colored phones. If we have options to color our products bezel it will make the data center look more inspiring and light colors will also reflect more light thus the energy spent to light the data center will reduce.
