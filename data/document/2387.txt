XtremIO BYOD Vblock
This would be a one stop shop for innovation and really handling today's mobile user. We would leverage XtremIO, Isilon, ViPR & Syncplicity. For virtual desktop images - XtremIO, all user data Isilon with Syncplicity wrapped around the shares, all control
Many customers have said if EMC could offer this as a solution I would certainly be interested as I would let them help me figure out all this BYOD and VDI in a cool unique way that users would actually want to do it. Visiting Nurse Services of NY and North Shore Long Island Jewish Healthcare system have a lot of real world needs here as they send a lot of staff into the field to meet with patients and gather data and they need to make sure that data can be uploaded remotely and securely.
This brings us to one storage ECO-System that would control the user from end to end. By implementing the Automation of the ViPR user portal I have now built all my SAN/NAS admins with an allow-Deny functionality that is 100% manual today. Every organization needs to share data but fumble on doing that securely, that's why having all the shares (user data) with syncplicity wrapped around it which gives an unprecedented secure remote access controlled by I.T. Security. All controlled by the VCE message "One Throat to Choke"
Fully implemented - Vblock 5xx (XtremIO), Isilon, Syncplicity, ViPR, Air Watch & potentially some APP work for full federation play. Based on customer needs all of these components can be put into the vblock however the XtremIO and Isilon are the core fou
