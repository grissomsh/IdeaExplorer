Intelligent repository  storage management in Documentum based on document usage to utilize different IO performance storage.
This idea would integrate Documentum with EMC Storage product and provide optimized storage policy for Documentum repository to get better I/O performance.
Sometimes we saw the customer got very large storage for Documentum repository, but no optimized storage management through Documentum. So we came up this idea to improve the performance for Documentum.
The idea is to integrate with EMC storage product, divide a storage to 2 parts, 1 part is high performance storage (like SSD disks) for "hot" documents, and the other part is slow performance storage (normal disks) for "cold" documents, and provide a background service to periodically migrate the "cold" documents to slow performance disks from high performance disks according predefined rules.(e.g. We could define those documents which are not be accessed in past 3 months marked as "cold" documents) This service will make sure all the "hot" documents are in the high performance storage to get better IO performance. And reduce the cost for total storage.(We could use less high performance storage for "hot" documents than the old way).
The idea would improve the customer satisfaction by improving the Documentum performance and reducing the storage cost.
