Develop some industry standards of storage management

The patents are good ways to protect intelligence rights. As the leader in the industry, we need to make sure we make rules for the industry and markets.
EMC can develop some technologies about the unified storage products, and make them patenting. so far i thought in following areas:
    * Storage management interface and API for interoperability.
    * Communication protocol to VMWare DataStore.
    * Failover protocol with 3rd party storages.
