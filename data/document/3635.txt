Wear Green,Care for Green

The idea came from being annoyed from smelling polluted air in Egypt all the time. One of the things that refresh the air is planting trees. EMC emplyees can be part of the change and do something beneficial to the society we are part of.
The idea is to allow EMC employees themselves to plant gardens or trees around EMC building.

We can assign a day of the week where EMC employees wear green clothes and participate in the "Care for Green" event.

It is great to contribute in the beauty of the environment. The idea is related to fun, it will get people out of work routine, in addition to the above mentioned benfits to our society.
