when thinking about challenges to have meetings with colleagues in remote sites
We propose a solution to integrate Lync with office meeting room.

In each meeting room, there will be camera, which is associated with a unique Lync account, which can be queried from a global registry. 

When you want to send meeting request, you can put the meeting room's Lync account in the invitation list. 

When the meeting starts, the Lync will start automatically, everyone in the meeting room will be captured and be viewed by other invited Lync users.

BTW. We can even add Lync in dinner room or public area, for colleagues among different sites to communicate with each other randomly.
