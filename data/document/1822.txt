Display Sky News in the coffee dock/reception area
Enhanced use of our display screens and relate to the real world would align our workplace with other companies, even within the federation. 
This idea was generated at an IT Idea Generation Session in Cork on 25th June.
Display SkyNews 24 on TV screens in public areas around the campus. May need to seek funding for licenses(?).
Staff know what's happening outside EMC. No interference in completing the day job as SkyNews does not require volume to be added.
