EPM2 Integration with Shared services & imap tools
the goal of the idea is to improve project initiation process through minimizing the amount of time project managers spend on gathering project related information 
the idea came up during PM conference and i discussed it with Oliver Koh 
merge the shared service and iMAP tool with EPM2 so that whenever the PM creates a project folder  in EPM2 the Pre-Architectural build and licenses from shared services are included in that project folder and Also account team detail from iMAP tool are listed in the folder as well 
it will minimize the total admin time which will allow PMs to focus more on billable hour and total customer experience
