Deploy array disk drive on demand in lab use cloud

I came up with the idea when raise LM to request drivers needed for my test. I need to wait for labman buy the driver since not enough in hand .
The solution to the above problem are as follows:
1. Deploy kinds of drivers on cloud , every array can request drivers on demand  by ourselves.
2. Monitor driver resource usage on cloud , improve driver utility rate. If some type driver is limited , find the driver have been deployed on array but not used , notify the user then reassign to whom need it.
3. Prepare the limited driver in advance from array request. It will save time for testing .
