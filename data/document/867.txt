"Unified Community Impression" Day
This will bring people together beyond various diversities and represent EMC as a Brand. In the current model, though EMC has various programs to give back to our community in one or the other way, it is optional to all the employees to be part of the program. This doesn’t bring together “EMC” as one organization to help the community in a large scale. 
At EMC, we do many of these programs but not as ONE, not as TOGETHER! We do these programs in bits and pieces but with respect to the employees, it’s optional. Only a few employees participate in the current model. Because many a times, it becomes difficult to get out of our routine work / meetings.  This can be addressed if we formulate a model as “Unified Community Impression” day where one day will be dedicated to serve our communities as much as possible. 
Every year, we should set aside a day “Unified Community Impression”  to deliver a lasting impression on our communities which will in turn helps us (EMC) to maintain our demonstrated position as a community leader.  This will aim at scaling our help as an organization to the communities in much bigger way. This will bring a positive change in our communities.  This day, all the EMC employees (excluding a few employees who are working on critical business projects) will come together as a unified TEAM to serve our communities. 

Charter of the program;

This program can be divided into numbers of threads/sections which will cater to different community services viz.  Akshaya seva (Education program) for underprivileged children,  Painting the schools/NGOs, Spending a day in orphanage by conducting painting/drawing contests for the kids, Join your hands for cleanliness awareness  - EG; lake cleaning exercises, planting trees in large way,  donating clothes/news papers to the blind schools, making some provisions to provide first aid box to the rural schools etc. The treads can be as many as we think. 

We do many of these programs at EMC but not as ONE, not as TOGETHER! Celebrating a Unified Community Impression day together as one EMC will bring pride in each and every employee of EMC, will add satisfaction to the change we bring to the community as ONE. 

It matters. Yes, it does!
