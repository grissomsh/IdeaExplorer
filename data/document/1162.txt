Change the World App
Community involvement towards a better future. Making use of cell phone, mobile apps, big data.
what if people willing to have a better country are given the opportunity to fix their country.
A mobile app where people register and create their own account or link it to Facebook.

When they notice anything they don't like, they take a picture of it, add the coordinates of the picture through the GPS , add a comment and post it.

So for example, if you find a bumpy road. Take a picture with the coordinates and post it.  If you find a garden not being watered. if you find a car not parked correctly. If you find a place that has potential to be transformed into a garden. If you find a place that needs cleaning, a place that need renewing and so on

The platform is to analyse all the posts and it generates a web platform with all the posts groups by region and/or by topic.

People responsible for those fixes could be contacted Government could contribute. Also groups that would like to contribute to a better country could post their willing into helping fix a certain issue. Also founders are welcomed to fund certain posts. 
By having people fund some projects, hiring temp employees to accomplish the tasks could be possible and thus participating in solving the unemployment problem in some countries.

So in brief ... people post the problem, people fund the payment and people fix the issue.


With the power of people, and little of coordination we can reach a better country.

In phase 2, a pointing system could be integrated and people get points based on their contribution. Those points are then rewarded by gifts.
increase community involvement
