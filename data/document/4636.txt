Mobile APP for Education Services Portal

I tried to search for mobile applications that have those features and i came through an application called Coursera so why not have our own educational application?
Having an application that is integrated with EMC Education Services Portal and allowing users to be able to:

-View the available courses
-Subscribe in one or more courses.
-View courses on their mobile phones and being able to solve tests/quizzes
-The ability to pause at specific part and resuming at any other time.
