Make the unisphere GUI support more browsers

Currently when we use the unisphere to launch the array,we just have to use the the IE.It does not support the others like the firefox.

I always met this issue when launch the unisphere, so I have to switch the browser.
Expand the supported browsers to support the Unisphere.
It would make the unisphere more easy to use and improve the popularity for unisphere.
