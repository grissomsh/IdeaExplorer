EMC Customer Aid

As an account SE, I try to be involved with my customers as much as possible in all aspects of their business. For example, I have noticed that customers will initially engage with consulting companies / VARs for things like data center moves not knowing that EMC is more than just an infrastructure company. As account teams currently maintain account information in shared folders using apps like Syncplicity, I believe we should utilize the power of our data analytics engine and extend this capability and information to our entire customer base where approved and applicable.
