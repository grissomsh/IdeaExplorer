The EMC Super 'App': Mail, Check-in, Team Cafe & SOS (Big 4 Functionality)
When the world is calling (almost) a daily moon shot at Super 'App' WE thought it is worth to aim at one from EMC perspective. This App can become 'the way of life' for every EMCer. Through the traffic, high & frequent usage it can be used to promote important messages, collaboration among teams & have features like SOS for IT Support. thus the App can project contemporary 
Outlook released a good enough App few months back, but as we came across the fact that it is not safe for us to use as data gets stored outside EMC premises we deleted it right away. While going back to default 'mail' app this occur to us in a conversation that we can do something basic which can have pull factor in classic mail & push factor on what EMC needs (contemporary employee communication & Collaboration) as well as 'cool' way to reach IT help Desk.  
Building an App with the right productivity hacks inbuilt to attract every EMCers to the 'Super App', So, How?
- Every morning first thing we do is to look at the boring iOS Mail Application or Android equivalent. Intact we check that app at least 20 times a day. it is now  possible now to integrate exchange account. Mail doesn't have much of the complex functionalities, replicating them using some 3rd party email application can be easy. 
- Additional Feature (Few & Important to not clutter the interface): 
-- 'Check-in' to EMC: GPS based checkin facility which activates the App when you enter EMC premises. (also you can activate this feature by logging through Airwatach/VPN)It delivers you the 'Day in Brief'/'Shout out' message from your colleague reading any important asks/ help needed. 
-- "Team Cafe': A Tab which has simple options like, 'Spark of the day' where you see your immediate team's idea & respond to it or 'water cooler' where you can start a chat which creates push notification to your team only
-- "SOS" to IT: This is basically your one touch IT customer service experience, which can have API calls to Lync- 'IT help' id on which you can chat or 'Panic' button where IT help desk can call you on the same mobile. 
If successful in implementation this app has potential of getting entire company on a literal single pane of glass. way from there to leverage & utilize this app can be multifold. If not all combination of few of the features mentioned above can be good next steps in leveraging our global diverse workforce.
