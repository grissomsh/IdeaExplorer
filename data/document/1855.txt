I wish we had a breakout/zen room
Employee wellness is a huge part of the modern day office environment. The modern workplace needs to cater for employees needs and give them the ability to take a few minutes out from their desk and clear their mind and re-focus.

This was raised as part of the Ireland IT Idea Generation Session lead by Darren O'Keeffe.
Some calming furniture and artwork in an enclosed space all play their part in providing an informal getaway within the formal office space.
A designated room, closed with comfortable sofa, some mats. Some funky colours on the wall. This removes stress and allows employees some quiet time to themselves.
