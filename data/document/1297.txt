VNXe Team Turnover Process Enhancement
My idea addresses process enhancement by eliminating admin work which may lead to customer dissatisfaction
In VNXe we work on chat support until our shift ends, and we usually Turnover cases to next shift for continuous support.
Filling the Turnover template and preparing the e-mail was such a headache that inspired me to create this tool. 
My solution was developing chrome extension that generate the Turnover template and fetches the necessary information from case notes ex.(Next action, site name, customer contact,..)
It will also prepare the e-mail with the correct DL to be send.
 
The success of this tool was minimizing the average time to submit the approval mail for Turnover from average 5 mins 31 sec.
