Next Genetartion Education TaaS :  "Teacher-as-a-Service!" for developing countries.

Previous experience working as a teaching assistant and using social media as a workaround to provide internet based teaching service. 
the idea works as follows:

-  Expertise pooling : we will have a pool of experienced teachers and a pool of students having access to the questions cloud using a web or mobile app.
- students access the cloud portal to submit his question in the relevant subject
- available teachers view the questions and answer them.
- notifications can be received when a question gets answered.
- students can rate teachers depending on the level of answers provided.
- the cloud can be applied on one school or group of schools leveraging the concept of private and public cloud.
- detailed design can be discussed such as (tips section/announcements section/wall of fame).
- a teacher is registered in one or more subject/year. a student subscribes to one or more subjects for his year of study.
- competitions can be held between schools online saving money and time needed for such events.
- the solution can be provided by EMC to Ministry of education to be applied in governmental schools.
- this will dramatically enhance the quality of education especially when the resources (teachers) are not enough to cover the need (students).
- the cloud can be managed under the umbrella of Education Ministry to promote skilled teachers and reward good students.
- when this solution is tested with some schools, the students result will be better. these better results will now then be the best marketing campaign for the solution.
