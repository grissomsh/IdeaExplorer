Virtual Expert panel
Maximise the use of existing technology to:
Improve communication across our multiple EMC and Federation sites
Deliver enhanced collaboration across EMCâ€™s Federation partners, and across the COE Ecosystem

Solution is currently impelemented in other orgs.
"Chat with an expert" - instead of using lync to find a friend use lync to find an expert - input your question and lync will use keyword matching to ping up to 5 people who can help.
     Lync will only message someone who is online
     Keyword matching would query multiple databases such as (training and certification, skills and education, job function etc.)
     Not just for technology questions could be anything (Finance, HR, Facilities etc.)
 
Option to opt in/out - but if you are using Lync correctly this should not be an issue as it will only ping you if you are available.

Improve customer satisfaction and enhance productivity
