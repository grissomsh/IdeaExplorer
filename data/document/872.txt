Federated Search using search catalogues maintained by Storage Systems
ECD has got strong presence in search and federated search services domain. We can make use of this and create a new solution using EMC core (storage) products.

A new product proposal which suits CTO office challenge

It is relevant to the APJ COE challenge as the defined problem and the proposed solution are very well applicable for the hybrid clouds.
Internal discussion and brainstorming
Portal to allow simultaneous/parallel search of multiple online storage (EMC & others) 
based on the search catalog maintained & published by each of them.

Search catalog primarily contains the basic metadata attributes of content maintained by the storage.

The storage will fall into any category ranging from cloud based to simple file/content store.
Thus storage could fall under variety of vendors not necessarily from EMC.

This will enable users to view search results in a single integrated list. 
Thus enabling them to search multiple search catalogs all at once.
The reduced time it takes to do a basic search is benefit enough.
Unified access to diverse content sources.
Simultaneous searching across all sources.
Ability to Simple search as well as advanced search.
Integrated results which are easy to view and use
Direct links to the native source for further searching.
Ability to filter, sort, save, print, export and e-mail search results
