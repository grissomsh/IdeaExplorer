I wish we could display twitter feeds on EMC monitors / displays 
aligned to contemporary workplace - building our social media footprint and providing current and relevant information ('tweets') to our employees. Getting EMC 'trending'.
Idea Generation Session 
Employees can tweet to EMC hashtags and create discussions groups, updates, information sharing. A great way to disseminate information across our workplace. 

One example of how they was used very effectively was at IT@Cork where there was a live twitter feed during the event. Imagine the impact if we could get EMC trending for IT All Hands, WLF, Great Place to Work, Product Releases, PR updates etc
A fully interactive twitter feed across EMC.
