database to update customer's contacts
it's an idea to facilitate TSE job reaching customers 
1- issues reaching customers
2- when i ask a cst to change a primary contact in the SR it's not reflected in the customer profile, it's only a change in the current SR.

build a database accesible for all the TSEs to update the customer contacts instead of sending mails to ASR or DSM or dispatch the case to provide a valid contact.

allowing TSE to edit and update customer contacts.

it could even be a part of the SYR tool  

and it could be synchronised with the contact list provided in the SR so i can switch it to a primary contact to help sending surveys to the right person and get more CSAT instead of contacting the CST to request a primary contact change.
consum time and effort, to get a valid contact.
TSEs will be able to change a primary contact and increase CSATs number
