EMC2 Products in Simple Terms
This idea will allow everyone have a common understanding of what our products are, what they do, how they are assembled and who uses them. This will improve how we communicate with each other about products while also helping build EMC Product affinity. 
Eugene’s manager requested he develop a high level product presentation. Mark Dullea, Michele Wilson and Fionn McGinley were asked to develop an idea to boost EMC Product Affinity  for a CMO newsletter. By combining our ideas, we worked together to create a prototype based on the VMAX family. Following positive feedback we created a roadmap and started covering all EMC’s products. Then with interest from GPO groups, we have included them in a wider team developing content.
Our ‘One Sheet’ solution describes each EMC product without using acronyms, technical terms or code names. We also use video and pictures to give a clear and consistent overview on each ‘One Sheet’. This solution allows anyone to utilize the resource and discuss/understand the product. We believe we are filling a gap given this resource doesn’t exist today. There is no standard introductory collateral for EMC’s products. By creating a comfort level with a particular product, the next step users can take is to study product spec sheets and white papers available on Inside EMC.
If fully implemented, our idea would be a single webpage showing all of EMC’s products/offerings. Each product will link to a ‘One Sheet’ resource detailing the Product in simple Terms, including text descriptions, product images and a video overview. Suc
