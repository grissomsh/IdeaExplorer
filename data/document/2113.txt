GPO HW/FW/SW tracking solution
Improve GPO/GHE operations more efficient and effective 
This year a DIMM issue is reported in field for VMX3 product and GHE was investigating .GHE VP stephen sent an email to me to ask if we see this issue in GHTS testware development and qualification . GHTS already has collected all data together so I just typed the "error message" in our own quality center system and find no similar issue then we want to see whether FW team saw this issue in developoment and qualification phase however they don't have such system so we need spend much efforts to review all    actvitity include test log/test result/document etc .We may continue to review this issue if it happened in GAME/MFG etc  . If we collected all design/test data together and origanized data well , we only need to spend very few efforts to find the desired informaiton  
  This is some-how similar with Food tracking system in industry 
  Currently we already collected GHTS development/test data and GPQE Firmware validation team test data together and provide web API to inject data into one place and search interface is available for use
Our solution collects all GPO HW/FW design/dev/test data together ,use FW version /HW SN as its identifier  so design data/test log/test configuration/test results will link to identifier .With this being said, we can easily know all the activities include both design/test/internal use data are available to one specific FW for instance . After data are organized ,leverage big data open source search tool : elastisearch as search engine for index,on top of that , provide  like google search WebUI for GPO users to search to easily and clearly understand development/qualification activity in each stop .The solution archetecture is here https://inside.emc.com/docs/DOC-154948 
If it is fullly implemented , people in GPO can query FW/HW/SW design/development/test activity through a simple search for different purpose . This will significantly improve efficiency for operation
