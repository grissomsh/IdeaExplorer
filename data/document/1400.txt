Credit Approval Eroom to SFDC Migration
This is a very crucial part when it comes to the Customer satisfaction issues. 
Since all the activities are moving to SFDC cases. So there should be a single platform controlling the activities of business.

There are so many system glitches in the currect credit approval E room. Also currently EMC is moving all the activities into SFDC platform. Hence this idea was generated to move this activity to SFDC. 
By upgrading the credit approval e room to SFDC case, there can be more efficient in the processing time, and the approver gets all the information since the case is linked to the original request.

The user can experience the SFDC more effectively compared to e room.

Since EMC is migrating into SFDC, there will be a centralized control and access to the users.

Better productive in the process. Efficiency can be increased. As mentioned. SFDC will be the single Platform for all the users. No mannual email or the alert to the approvers.
