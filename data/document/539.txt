EMC Official Podcast - EMC News, Product Releases, Customer Questions 
This idea could match a whole host of challenges as it's really just about EMC harnessing the  popularity of Podcasts as a way of addressing the industry - specifically taking EHC based challenges as an example a specific Podcast could address customers security concerns about embracing the hybrid cloud platform. 
Podcasts are becoming more and more popular since the viral phenomenon of Serial. I searched for EMC content and found the EMC Podcasts to be very unorganized and unrelated. A single monthly EMC Podcast was the idea which emerged from that. 
Create a monthly, singular EMC podcast for new product releases, code updates, features, customer questions, etc to promote EMC and make an impression to the technical community. 
Popular podcast which generates online buzz and customer awareness of upcoming releases from EMC. If the podcast made an impression on Podcast charts or got online recognition as being worth the time of the average IT person downloading and taking points on board then i think this would make it worth the investment.
