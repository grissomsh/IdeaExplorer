Use Big Data for visibility into customer sentiment about pre-sales demos and hands-on labs
This idea answers the TCE Challenge by using big data to gather customer and prospect sentiment data about pre-buy challenges, and enabling timely and strategic decision-making by the vLab team to focus on and prioritize the most desirable and impactful l
 Big data analytics has been considered by vLab as a way to correlate demos to customer sales (a major hurdle to date), and while exploring that the idea came about that it might also make sense to use customer sentiment to drive content creation.   vLab is challenged with providing labs for all BU's but is dependent on product Marketing to determine priority and content based on new releases and sales-campaigns, which don't necessarily align to customers near-term buy-decision needs.  This seems like a logical way for vLab to ensure those customers needs are met as well. 
EMC has a huge social media presence now with EMC branded accounts for Corporate, various Marketing and BU and product groups, theaters, and even vLab.  We also know all consumers looking to make a "buy" decision are "chatty," and they ask friends and colleagues about their experiences with products.  Using big data gathering and analytics on social media conversations, vLab could more quickly determine trends and which hot topics and products customers want to "play with" or are curious about.  This would enable the vLab team to modify the lab release roadmap more dynamically and confidently, to ensure the timely release of desirable and valuable content.  
Faster, more focused content creation with proven relevance to the market.  Shorter sales cycles.  Increased customer satisfaction and confidence in EMC to deliver.  Reduced time-to-value for customer needs.
