Interactive plant map

Just after starting work in EMC, initially I've found it difficult to find the places that I was looking for. This lead to coming up with the idea of interactive maps.
Interactive map would provide directions based on current location and selected destination. To improve usability and real time directions, it could be available on mobile devices like phones and tablets.
