The Universal License Key for ELA Customers/ Specific Software 
This idea needs to be discussed with product management for each product to see how it will be possible to create this. 
Several issues with ELAs and adding new products to existing ELAs. 
Ex: SRM and adding new part numbers of SRM on that ELAs for new platforms > instead we would create one universal SRM license key. 
Create universal licensing keys for the products that do not lock for ELAs. There are some software products that do not lock to a specific hardware. For ELAs, we can create one part number that would generate one license key used on all. 
Saves time and effort.
Less upgrade ELAs manually. 
Better customer service and less issues with ELA customers.
