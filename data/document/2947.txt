Runbook\Migration workbook automation
Runbook\Migration work book automation would help the DCM team to maintain accurate details of the resource utilization which would help in better planning and bundling of servers based on their utilization.
I thought of this Idea based on the challenges faced during the DCM activities where some incorrect mapping would lead to delay in actual execution and would cost more.
This utility would help DCM team  in sizing estimation based on their analysis of the current utilization and\or any specific customer requirement\request. By having this utility we can make sure that the resource utilization\provisioning is not been over utilized or we do not run short of resource. For example while planning for set of production servers move based on the resource availability the right target can be selected based on  resource availability post movegroup=Total availability-Resource required for specific move.  Resource availability post movegroup would be the total availability for upcoming groups. 
Having right resource calculation would help the DCM activity to save time by avoiding incorrect mapping and inaccurate resource request. Having this utility would help on time delivery and be cost effective.
