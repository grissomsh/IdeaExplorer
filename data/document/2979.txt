Talent Enrichment Program (TEP)to help promote diversity in innovation
This idea provides a way to help bring diversity into mature organizations to help spark and enable innovative thought processes. This idea taps into the diverse talent that already exists and can be applied to virtually any organization within EMC.
My staff and I came up with the idea trying to find ways to broaden the skills and operational command of the business of our organization's talent given there were limited number of lateral and promotional opportunities. We have since communicated the plan and model to my organization and requested volunteers to see if we could find an appropriate match. We did find two individuals and have initiated a pilot of this program this quarter.
Implement a job swap program aka Talent Enrichment Program. The solutions consists of identifying two individuals within different groups of your organization at the same job grade level and have them swap roles for a period of 6 months. Why 6 months? This timeframe is long enough for individuals to come up to speed in the new role and make a meaningful contribution to this new group. It is short enough such that they do not get too disengaged from their former role so that once the swap is over they come back without much set-back. Benefits:  1) The two individuals get a new perspective of EMC from the swap role without risking their current position , 2) Allows an organization to leverage the diversity within the organization more broadly across the organization, 3) Enables innovation through a set of fresh eyes and ideas into the groups the swap roles exist.
