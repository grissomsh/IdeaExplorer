Recognition Program For Licensing Agents 
This is a new process that needs to be in place. 
Efforts my go unrecognized by management which might demotivate individuals. 
We don't have a place on the wall of fame. 
Create a new program that would award a licensing specialist per quarter based on his/her numbers driven by the team metric. Once we are on Sales Force, we will have new reporting tools that will be used to generate the data needed. Based on this data, individuals with potential should be given a reward ( can be a day off or a cause for applause..etc.)  
Will boost the team spirit and numbers.
Will create a sense of urgency and something new within the team.
Will align with the global strategy of other teams where outstanding employees get recognized. 
Will motivate new employees and existing as well. 
Will create a sense of pride.
