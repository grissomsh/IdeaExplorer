Train the Trainer - Cross functional training delivery Program
This program idea will help to increase diversity of skills and employees' inclusion and contribution
I got this idea when I found a lot of employees who wish to contribute and share their knowledge but lack the skill of training delivery.


My idea is to provide training (Train the trainer) to interested employees.

An employee with a skill set to deliver the content training to interested employees, who will later receive train the training courses to be able to be the next who deliver the same content to other employees whether from the same department or across the center.

This will increase EMC employees capability to deliver training to their colleagues which will increase employee engagement and sense of contribution.
This program will help people to diversify their skills.
