Guidebook to Acronym's
I think this idea relates to the challenge as it looks at improving communication.Communication is essential to make any workplace efficient and effective. 
I came up with this idea when I had to write down alot of commonly used acronym's and I thought it would be helpful if there was one place I could get all this information from.  
My idea looks at having a simple guidelines manual for commonly used product/ service acronym's used in EMC. For new employees especially, it is very complicated to understand all the acronym's used by various departments.  
I feel that their are alot of benefits generated from this idea. Most importantly, employee communication will be improved as they know what the acronym's stand.
