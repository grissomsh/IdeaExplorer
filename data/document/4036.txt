Use of anonymous peer reviews to identify leaders in the organization.

Often I see people leaving the organization complaining about lack of direction and confidence from leadership. This can be identified early and the damange can be prevented.
Potential leaders could be identified and regular feedback (half yearly or quaterly) from reporter and reportees using an anonymous survey rating the candidate on various aspects like technical competence, strengths, weekness, communication, visionary, team player. This will provide much more valuable feedback for the managers to make decisions on promotions and bonuses and identifying and retaining the key talent. This can be integrated into the review and quaterly goals process and generate a win-win for the organization and the candidate. The HR analytics tool can use the law of averages, history and accomplishments to predict the potential leaders and identify candidates due for a promotion.
