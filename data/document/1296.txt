Product Summary Broshure
Increasing the awarness of the new comer or anyone interested in the procust will raise the customer satisfaction.
The idea came out from the sessions that were done by the R&D virtual team.
My idea would be to have a small broshure about each product that summarizes the product and its uses.
This broshure should help the GSAP and new comers to have an overview about all the products of EMC.
It should serve not only new comers but also all the employees who are keen to know about a specific EMC product.

The broshure should be around 4 pages, not more and not less than that. 
The knowledge learned from the broshure should be sufficent enough for anyone interested about the procudt.
