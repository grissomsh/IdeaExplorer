Shadow the leader
Can be a GPTW initiative
This idea is around innovative HR practices that the company can follow also this is in practice across some companies in US & India
The top performers in the company can be given an opportunity to shadow the top management leader for a day or couple of days and learn from the best. the leader can share his experience and the person shadowing the leader can learn and get to see how he/she operates and thinks about the future
This kind of leadership connect program will help create new leaders within the organization and will support the GPTW
