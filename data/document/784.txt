Smart Home Platform
Developing methods to introduce smart city and have remote control over electricity's usage.
Some incidents happens to people when they forget their air conditions running after they travel abroad or forget other devices in home.
Introduction:
We will be creating a sensor attached to each electricity device in home such as fridge, air conditions and even light lamps.

The sensors will be all connected to centralized application/server where each householder can have access to it through secured internet channel.
The server can be accessed either from computers or mobile devices.

Interface:
Platform will have list of available devices in home and with the status of it (Turned on or off)
Each device will be as well calculating the average usage of power in Watt unit and total power for home will be calculated.

Depending on the device, You will be able to change the status of it such as: Turning off, on or even reducing the power provided to each.
Success would be seeing people using that kind of technology to have control over their houses to reduce the risk of incidents and saving their time
