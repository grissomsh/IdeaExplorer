OnDemand EduLabs

We are implementing vCAC for couple of customers including EMC IT which automates the provisioning of virtual servers, desktops and even physical servers. 

The same solution can be customized to address this challenge.
Sridhara Santhosh, Satya Jha and Naresh Madiraju developed the idea
We evaluated VCAC for solving the idea challenge and did some brainstorming sessions for “what if” situations

No manual intervention: 
Self-service to request technical labs and are provisioned automatically. Technical labs are provided on-demand as a cloud service
Integrated workflows:
 From a user request and administrative approval through decommissioning and resource reclamation
Modular Architecture:
Provision and manage multi-vendor, multi-cloud infrastructure and applications leveraging existing infrastructure tools and processes 
Service Catalog:
•	Service Catalog approach where training coordinators can browse the catalog to request required labs, schedule, track their requests and manage the provisioned items
•	New services can be defined and publish to the common catalog
