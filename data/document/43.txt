Implementing security for Internet of Things
The challenge talks of implementing security for internet of things, in our idea we discuss about implementing the security at various levels for internet of things

Security implemented at the

a)  individual device level

b) at the network level

c)  at the entire system level that constitutes
   one or more IoT devices with software in cloud controlling it.
We thought of this idea few months back while discussing about security issues for IoT devices, but we did not implement any of these idea.
We discuss about how our idea solves the security problem at network level, device level and system level
in the below document

Some of the idea discussed are general security principles that are used in computer industry but we have implemented few new ideas that will create a secure echo system and detect a abnormal state.

EMC would have a secured IoT implementation if the idea was completed and deployed in field.
