Interconnecting various EMC groups through EMC specific social community hangouts
There are quite a lot of teams .. Mainly Onsite Team, Offsite team, Project management, Service operations and Quality Assurance for any particular client or project specific task.. On a general note, people do work together professionally and just have professional acquaintances.. But they are not familiar with each other on a casual perspective and hangouts can help in people understand and know about each other in various teams which are collaborating and integrating with each other for project delivery.. 
Based on personal real time experiences in previous organizations where I had worked.. 
hangouts can help in people understand and know about each other in various teams which are collaborating and integrating with each other for project delivery..
More understanding and know how about various people in a project delivery means better quality in service delivery and better prospects for company for more revenue through service delivery..
