NEO training for interns
This idea needs HR team to sponsor and organize.
I am new comer as an intern in EMC family. I have been working here for nearly a month, but I don't really know much about EMC's business objectives, corporate culture, product lines and so on. This feeling is very bad.
HR team organizes NEO training for interns. 
This is an efficient way for new interns to quickly learn and integrate into EMC.
