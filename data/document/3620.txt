Big Data Champions

Based on a previous idea I submitted in Innovation conference 2012, But it targeted younger age students.
A One Month School Campaign that targets High school students , To let them Know what is Big Data & Cloud Computing .

IT will help create a young & informative youth that by the time they start working & building their careers, they could be real champions in the field, already aware what is Big Data & Cloud Computing.
