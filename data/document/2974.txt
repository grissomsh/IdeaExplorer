Employee Emergency Help-line
Having a centralized help line number embedded in the badge would help employees to  get the help during emergencies like road accidents
I got this idea when one of my friend faced  a situation where no one can find his whereabouts  till next day morning.
Setup a centralized employee helpdesk and provide a toll free number into the employee ID badge. Or print the emergency contact number on the badge to report any incidence.
Quick communication about the employee to company as well as the family member to take further action .  Provides confidence in  safety and security for the employees who work for EMC.
