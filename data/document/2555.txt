Good Bye Ol' Hard Copy Delivery - Hello New Soft Copy Transmission.....of NCPL paperwork!
This idea ties in very much with the GPO Challenge in that it directly augments & enhances process efficiency in the GPO/EMC supply chain and directly drives cost out of operations with a direct hard saving net result.  Electronic Doc Submission Solution.
ICO Mgt (Brendan O'Connell) in ICO (International Customer Ops Cork) initiated this with a view to making our process more 'paperless' and efficient.  We have been working on the email submission testing over a number of months, but due to the number of file conversions the barcode quality was degraded, so other options, including an FTP server are now being explored. 
Wave goodbye to the physical delivery from warehouse to EMC plant 4 times daily and say hello to a more modern day soft copy version.  While physical delivery may be highly effective, this benefit is far outweighed by the inefficiencies of having somebody hand delivery documents 4 times daily.  This substitution of this physical transfer with a soft copy transmission would be done via an FTP server or perhaps the use of Synplicity.  Flex can set up an FTP transfer from their shared folder where all the files are currently dropping each time a picklist and serial list is generated on their system Atlas. This would decrement actual cycle time and Cost.  A must do for a people company that happens to work in Technology!
Files can be further cataloged by Country into subfolders for easy id & access by EMC. Files on average sent to EMC - qty 350 daily & 1800 weekly.  Submitting in softcopy format catapults the current process into 2015, hard savings & increases productivity.
