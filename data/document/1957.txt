Energy-generating fan
Saving energy out of EMC product
All hardware solutions have fans that are used to cool the product.
The fans run continuously and their mechanical activity can be used to regenerate power that will be used within the product
Connect rectifiers and coils to the fan to have energy generated as the fans run.
This energy can initially be used to power non-critical parts of the hardware solution, like LEDs and LCDs.
Having energy generated by the fan reused within the hardware product
