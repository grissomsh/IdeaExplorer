Tool to remind about the un-authorized and illegal software installation

We received lots of emails about EMC Security Strategy asking us to uninstall the un-authorized software. And in the mail, it mentioned that the un-authorized software list will be uploaded to the wiki. People need to go to the wiki and check which software should be removed from his/her laptop. This is not efficient enough. Since we already got the un-authorized software list and why not sending an reminding email to the employee to ask he/she to uninstall the software directly. I believe this will help employee to adhere to EMC Security Strategy much better.
The tool should start itself and scan the laptop periodically. It should has the ability to check whether the software installed by users are un-authorized or not. If it's un-authorized, put it in a list. After the scan finished, send out an remind email to the employee and attached all the un-authorized software on the employee's laptop and ask he/she to uninstall it.
