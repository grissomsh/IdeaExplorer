Platforms for staff communications

Smartphones are a powerful computing device that are in widespread use. An Eircom household Sentiment survey in April 2013 showed that over 51% of the population has a smartphone. 
As communication usage trends shift, three quarters of those aged 16-24 say they now prefer to send text messages rather than have a phone conversation. 
Smart phone adoption rates are increasing across the globe. More staff carry a smartphone. This idea is to enable your own device to access specific applications. For example - check your work rota, org chart, inside EMC blog etc. The smartphone could also be used for internal tweets or text, voice communications instead of using outdated internal companion phones.
