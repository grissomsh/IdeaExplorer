Provide a wireless and mobile way to make a presentation
For IT contemporary workplace challenge, a wireless projection could bring us more efficiency and less IT support requests.
For HR challenge, a wireless projection could make it not only great but also cool place to work.
We could work with the mobile way
The idea comes from my experience of using apple airplay mirroring. 
Enable wireless projection with airplay.
1. For meeting room with apple TV, it has been already enabled the airplay feature. 
2. For meeting room with other TV or projector, we have two options. 
a. Install software supporting airplay on projector-connected computer. E.g. AirServer.
b. Setup an airplay adapter device for the projector or TV. E.g. AirEnabler Adapter Kit. 
Use cases:
After Interview meeting, the candidate would tell others that it’s pretty cool to present my resume and projects by his mobile device. 
In a brainstorming meeting, everyone could present his ideas in hands smoothly. 
Some engineers could discuss and draw the design graph with the mobile mirroring to projector. It’s a green work style to use mobile rather than white board. 
Make it cool to be a presenter. 
Enhance productivity.
