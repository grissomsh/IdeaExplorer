Common Database Tracking EMC CMs' MFG Yields and Failures Worldwide
A Global CM Yield/Failures Database will:
* make GPO/EMC’s supply chain and manufacturing operations more efficient and effective
*  position EMC’s hardware platforms, manufacturing and supply chain to be competitive in a 3rd Platform environment (includi

A new database for all 3rd-Party suppliers’ yields and failures tracking worldwide
* Structured to allow real-time access from all EMC locations and suppliers worldwide
* EMC SAP “back-end” linked to custom MS Access/HTML “front-end” application
* Information exchange with suppliers via “flat files”
* Automatic posting and/or retrieval to suppliers’ FTP sites/web portals
* Suppliers don’t need to access EMC internal network – no Network Access Agreement (NAA) required!
* Provide quality data in a timely manner to internal/external customer
* Centralized MFG yield and failure data to assess/monitor the quality of 3rd Party suppliers and products
* Easier to incorporate with EMC MFG yield data without the need for EMC and
