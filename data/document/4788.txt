Department Activities

brainstorming session
Each department will be responsible for a specific activity for example 1 department will be responsible for charity work, another for entertainment and so on.
But it will be rotational so that each department will cover every kind of activities.
When a department will be responsible for an activity there will be no need for breaking the ice and they will directly go ahead to serve this responsibility.
