Save the environment Campaign
The idea will engage EMC employees to reduce energy consumption, and it will make them more familiar with and able to articulate EMC's environmental priorities.
There is a lot of energy wasted each day in all EMC premises (light, power, papers, printers,....etc.) and people will follow the environmental instructions better if a friednly encouraging campaign took place.
The idea is to have small colorful tags (stickers) on each area or devise, where energy can be saved.
For example a small sticker can be tagged just under the light button: "Please keep me off when you do not need me". 
And some other instructions on the printer, refregerator, coffee maker...etc.
Where all stickers are all put in all EMC premises worldwide with unified logo, like: 

"EMCÂ²
Save the Environment"
Save tons of money for EMC spent on wasted energy and resources
More environmental friendly culture
