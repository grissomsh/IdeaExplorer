Customer Opportunities As A Service (COAAS)

None
There are around 1400+ (https://angel.co/life-sciences) life science startups, most of them are trying to solve business problems using cloud/big data technologies. Even though they are technologically good they lack man power in sales team. Some of the tech startups are not making good progress because they don't have good customer exposure.

As EMC is a big company and has good number of customers, these customers can be used to run field trails of some innovative solutions built by these tech startups. Basically EMC can act as a channel partner for these solutions and demo these solutions on EMC cloud/big data platform.
This helps in reducing the investment cost for the startups & increases the chances for goto market strategy. 

This is a win-win situation for both the startups & EMC.
