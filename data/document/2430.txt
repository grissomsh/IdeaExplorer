Asset floor plan mapper mobile app
IT contemporary  workplace needs a smarter solution to 
transform office floor plans into an interactive office map. Search and locate employees, meeting rooms and printers.
Practical problem faced in the past finding conference rooms
Extremely simple solution based on landmark[ known location] to asset routing.
The application doesn't try automatically  to identify the location of the person who is trying to search and locate, rather does the following:

1.Gets the information about the asset being searched and locates it.
2.Gets information about his/her location and directs him to landmarks nearby.
3.Upon confirming the landmark being reached, the system will provide precise instructions to locate the asset(employees, meeting rooms and printers) .
 
Example use case: 
1> User types " Alexandra Conference room" in search field.
2>System know that this is located in 7th floor Bldg2 ICOE Bangalore" based on query results from EMC Exchange server.
3>System asks you to select your floor and the building you are in
4> based on the inputs eg 8th floor, the system directs you a nearby known landmark that is easy to spot example: 8th floor lobby.
5>Upon reaching the lobby, the system will give you precise instructions to reach the destination with asset pinned and highlighted on  2D floor plan of  7th floor.


Technical implementation:

The system's backed  is implemented using a simple graph database like Neo4J or Cassandra. Each asset with rich mete data is connected to other assets via landmark nodes. 

The front end is implemented as an HTML5 app. 2D floor plans of all EMC buildings are digitized  using an image map component solution  with all assets plotted with 
their coordinates for mouse over and zoom functions.
