Online submission of the request for Customer's for Compatibility request.

I have seen situation where we have the Service request for Compatibility and we suggest to direct to SAM and there is not tracking done hence lost in Time.

So in the Benefit of the Customer and product to progress we can have this Open to Cusotmers to Give their requirement.
There should be a place in support.emc.com where customer can Raise a request for the Compatibility of a product with third party / dependent product.

This request should be directed to IIG_feild_interlock team and they can consolidate and request to engineeing .

this way we can track with the Site ID + we have count of what are the products our customers are using , we can proceed in that direction.
