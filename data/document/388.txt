Interactive tutorial/troubleshoting guide with "augmented reality" approach based automation testing tools for GUI
I suggest solution to improve troubleshooting and teaching end user. 
Idea based on my automation test experiance and creating text based instruction for other team members. I found that there is possibility to use automation test tools like Selenium for Web or AutoIT for Standalone applications (or any other like HP QTP, Squish, Test Complete)  to create interactive instructions for end user. This is adoption of use case automated testing to user teaching or support system troubleshooting.
I suggest to implement scenario based testing with automated GUI testing tools to create use cases based tutorials (both tutorialand troubleshooting guide) with usage real systeam and real user data (not in sysntetic environments). Such tools can be Selenium for web based applications, AutoIt for windows based applications and others. 

As next step I suggest implement abstration laval as declarative language do describe scenarious (domain specific language). 
Depending of software types to be investigated (during troubleshooting or first usage) there will be separate process launches the application (or open it in browser) and providing user simple menu on top of the application where user can select which scenario he wants to realize. After scenario will be selected and started automation testing tool will provide user info which button to click next or which filed with which info should be filled next. This scenario will follow and teach step by step user how to fix problem or perform some use case. There is no additional needs to read text based manual for initial usage or see non-real video tutorial. User will be toucht on real app with his real use cases and data.
