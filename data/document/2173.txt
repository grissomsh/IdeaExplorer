IJP opportunities for all BU's equally
People from CSS look forward for an IJP for PS team or delivery specialist at TSS. but these vacancies never come up and engineers from CSS dont get a chance to groom their carrer in EMC with different fields. hence the move is made beyond EMC and people lookout for a beeter role outside EMC which increases the iteration.
the idea came after seeing gsap hired for PS which could have been done internally at least for few vacancies. people work in CSS , learn the product and when they dont get a chance for a different role job in EMC , the search is made outside.
if there are 2 openings in a BU, one should be made internal, which means 50 percent of the vacancies should be a part of IJP rather than hiring from outside. it will help people epxlore different roles in EMC and will help CSS engineers to groom their career with a good profile.
this will help EMC as the person will be well known with the product and less training will be spent for a candidate. this wuill help the individual as well to make a career growth in the same firm.
