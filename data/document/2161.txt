EMC solution simulator
EMC has got many products under its belt. When a customer looks for a solution be it from a storage, backup, security, software , they do not know what are the products.
When i joined EMC i was keen to know about the product map. It took almost a Year to know about the type of products EMC has
This solution will be interactive for customers and internal users to understand the products that EMC has and from a very high level. 
e.g we can provide a shockwave video of a datacenter and customer should be able to click on each part and can explore the product map from EMC
This will ensure that the customer is well aware of our products and the area for which they are looking for
It should be a small simulation UI where any customer/Employee of EMC can use it to explore different product range we have.
