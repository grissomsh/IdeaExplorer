Documentum as a Service & Use of Open Source Technologies
- Usability enhancement for Enterprise content driven solutions
- Easy Access of Content, Anytime  anywhere
- Seamless Integration with applications
- Using EMC core products and technologies to leverage the capabilities of Documentum
- Use of Opensource technologies to rejig the tightly coupled existing environment to make it better suited for latest market demand


With the growing need of content management and for an enterprise and data mining techniques using big data platform and analytic tools. We need a very powerful Content management system that can meet the market growing needs.
To achieve that EMC is well capable of providing the same with it's products like Greenplum for analytics, Pivotal for the cloud platform, Spring for Rapid application development.
Keeping in mind the journey to Cloud and moving towards 3rd platform we propose our Idea.
With the use of Opensource platforms and technologies we can have isolated Documentum functionalities available as a Service to us within Pivotal, which would leverage EMC cloud platform.
These Documentum Services can be used inside any application just by linking the end-point to it.
We can have the Front end developed using any opensource technology like Angular, Bootstrap jQuery etc.
Providing these Services would make integration with Spring platform easier.
We are well aware of the fact that more than 70% of the whole enterprise apps are built using Spring. Providing a Spring integration API in Documentum would be a huge plus in the Developers community. The solution would not be bounded by technologies. We can have this integration for Ruby, .net, Java etc.

Building an analytics module on top of the Enterprise Content.
Most of the time to enhance business sales we would require answers to some basic questions like
 - How many orders were placed in California.
 - The Sales graph for any region
 - Which product is most popular among our customers and partners.
 - Are there any abnormalities in the System.

The question list can be endless, And to answer all the questions we can integrate a big data and analytics module with the content server.
- Documentum API for Spring would be used to easily integrate Content management capabilities to any application.
- Open Source customization's can give developers and business owners the choice of technology stack they want for the application.
- Providing services of documentum core functionalities would eventually increase the usage of docbase content servers. 
- mobile friendly interfaces would enable end users to access and use their application anytime - anywhere.
