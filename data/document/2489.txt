VPLEX LUN Modification update at Host
Current Challenges: When we expand a Virtual Volume in a VPLEX environment, the host will not be able to recognize the additional changed size, till the time file system expansion at the host end is completed, which is a difficult task depending on variou
During Product Solution and Implementation this idea came up.
Solution Approach:
Developing a feature at the VPLEX level, which will automatically update the new sized Virtual Volume with just a rescan at the host end, would reduce the various tasks performing at the OS level.
Since we already have a feature in VPLEX, to update the LUN information while the migration is in progress to some other array LUN, approach towards developing this new feature can be done.
This could be achieved also by running a agent at the host end, which will be generic for various platforms.
However approach towards developing agent less will be more impact in terms of VPLEX as a product.

Result and Product Impact: 
As this feature is not available in the market with any of the competitor product for VPLEX, this will be a USP for VPLEX market.
It would save the critical administration task for the customer,  so Sales will be helped in term
