Dummy fixture for testing
Using a dummy fixture can help to reduce the real physical fixture/part's abrasion/damage, save the cost and improve the working efficiency in manufacturer, especially for the process/product need frequently using the shipping part as a test fixture durin
When Flex Zhuhai came to asking for heatsink thermal grease purchasing and PO release from EMC, I was on the mail list and aware of that process and considered there were lots of redundant operation steps/actions by doing so. Have mentioned the idea how to avoid the extra assembly/disassembly, clean, thermal grease printing process with Robert Dien(SBMT NPI engineer) and Randy Yuan(Data Domain Hardware engineer) with the dummy heatsink concept. This also need check/study with the heatsink vendor/manufacturer such AAvid, Foxconn to see whether they have similar dummy heatsink/thermal grease substitute material already applied on field.
Idea is trying to find a dummy heatsink with the same heat dissipation function but not using the thermal grease, or a real heatsink not using the thermal grease but use a substitute material, so it can avoid thermal grease residue/pollution on the board,also no need to re-apply the thermal grease again on the heatsink for recycling and shipment purpose. 
The operator has to manually clean every board after the SFT test, and there is risk to cause thermal grease residue drop into the CPU socket and ambient component; And the recycled heatsink should apply thermal grease again before using, they need to use a stencil when apply thermal grease to ensure the thickness and volume meet requirement; Also the thermal grease consumption will claim to EMC.

If this can be successfully implemented, it can obviously improve the working efficiency and output in board manufacturers to avoid the dis-assembly/cleaning/thermal grease print and other redundant handlings caused workmanship error, also can save therma
