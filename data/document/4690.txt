Improve EMC support mobile App

Sometimes, I need to view or make a quick change to an SR,I couldn't have a quick access to the Service center. However, I could only view the SR from the support app, its becoming very useless to have an app with no features.
The app is already available in EMC app store. Basically you can view the Service Requests in this app, and that is it.

The improvements I am looking to address:
1. Logging notes.
2. Open and closing Service requests.
3. Re-queuing the service requests when needed.
4. Receiving notifications if any change happened in the SR.
5. Changes can be done by employees and customers.
