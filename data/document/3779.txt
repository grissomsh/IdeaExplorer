Earth to EMC: Plastic Pollution of our Oceans and Oceans of Data

One of our plastic packaging suppliers presented information about plastic pollution in our oceans to EMC.  During that talk, it became evident that EMCâ€™s data storage infrastructure, analytic capacity, and involvement with STEM education make EMC an ideal participant in addressing this global problem. 
EMC creates a technology and solutions platform to engage our customers, communities, and employees in addressing the problem of plastic pollution in the oceans.  This platform would allow for the collection and analysis of data made available for public study. We would create a mobile app that people or groups (NGOs, governments, schools) could use to log the occurrence or type of plastic appearing in waterways.  We would create or leverage existing modules for STEM education that would involve students in the analysis as well as the actual data collection in the field.  Employees would be encouraged to support their communities through citizen science engagement. Marketing and Sales could leverage this platform as a way to display how our Analytics as a Service and product offerings can be used to address complex problems in real time.  We would partner with government agencies like NOAA http://marinedebris.noaa.gov/who already has an app for trash reporting http://www.marinedebris.engr.uga.edu.   We will also partner with NGOs such as 5 Gyres http://5gyres.org/see_global_research/ who are actively collecting data about the plastic gyres in our oceans.  Educational partners such as Woods Hole, University of CA-Irvine are also involved in addressing the issue of plastic pollution in our oceans.
