Smart Transportation
It is totally matches the challenge, it is depending on the IoT and how we can use them to save our time and our energy specially "oil and gas energy"
I do not have a car I used to use the public transportation so that I know what horrible is it, so that I asked myself a question, what is, if we have an organization that using the internet to control these buses what is if the buses are connected and controlled by this organization via GPS devices.
You will not find any crowded place, all of the population will find buses at every bus station. the rush hour will be handled easily, and ..etc
By using the GPS solution for every bus in our public transportation, we can get the answers of numerous questions like:
How many cars are on the roads now?
How many driver work on the roads?
How many area are served with the public transportation?
How long they take to reach a specific place at a specific time?
How, How,  HOW, â€¦ etc?
That will let us control and improve our public transportation and traffic.
The public transportation will be smart transportation, controlled, organized, and safe. the life will be easier than before, will save time, energy "oil and gas", money and will give our government the opportunity to give us better services.
