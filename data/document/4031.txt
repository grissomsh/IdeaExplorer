Location Authenticator

Regarding to my daily work as RSA SecurID TSE and my little experience is the security and Identity and access management field, i think about how to use the 3rd generation in the authentication process by more innovative and creative way of authenticating the users
Most of us now are using smart phone, we can use a mobile application connected to an authentication server, which we can define some safe locations coordinates like the user COE coordinate and mark this place as save location for this user.

The user can authenticate once when he is located in this safe location by a passcode, then every-time he is asked for authentication for his machine he can use a bar-code scanner, it will be perfect it this authentication can be a single sign on for all his application.
