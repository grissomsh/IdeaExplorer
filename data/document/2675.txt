Collaboration platform for developers
This solution will leverage one of the ECS products to make use of the cloud capabilities.
I used to be a software developer before joining EMC. Sometimes,I want to share my code with other developers and need to work from anywhere on my code.
Instead of writing code on your own local machine.your code will be placed in cloud.
This solution will provide many features:
1-you can have your own virtual machine vm with your preferred os to build a windows app or an open source one (Platform as a Service PaaS)
2-run code quickly
3-multiple programmers can works on the same code
4-share your code with others by specifying accessibility levels(editing,viewing,...)
1-EMC will enter the open source area which will show its capabilities in this area
2-Cloud based solution which is easy to use fro any device
