Enhance the VPLEX to support OpenStack

Our team will focus on the integration for OpenStack and VNX. As the powerful virtualization storage solution, VPLEX should support more virtualization products except the VMware.
Implement a Simple, affordable, virtual storage availability platform that deploys as a set of hardware-independent, virtual appliances on your existing any VM infrastructure and managed through the OpenStack.
