Cross-BU meetings
- HR Challenge - Diversity and Innovation at a Great Place to Work.
Our idea is THE formula for diversity and innovation.
- IT Contemporary Workplace Challenge
Our innovation will allow employees to collaborate on any topic, including IT.
We thought about this idea a week ago, during out local cross-BU meeting :)
We should create a cross business-units teams, which will include employees from various BUs across the federation. The cross-BU meetings will create a unique opportunity for employees to share current practices, tasks and challenges they face. This environment will encourage cross pollination, knowledge sharing and innovation. This is achievable since members from different BUs create a diverse set of points of view. Another advantage of the cross-BU team is that the employees will expand their social and professional networks within the federation.
In order to increase the efficiency, we suggest creating several layers of such teams, e.g. product managers level, engineers level, finance, HR, etc. Each layer will create its unique diversity and innovation opportunities.
