Customer Issue Sharing Platform
We are doing ViPR system test, which requires us to simulate customer like environment to run the cases. As we don't have much contact with the real customers, sometimes the test plan we made can't cover some real situation the customers really concerned. So, we need to follow up the newest customer issues.
We held a customer issue sharing meeting every week to update information about the problems our customers run into recently. The meeting is quite useful, so this idea came into my mind. Why not build a customer issue sharing platform to help us get related information timely?
Built a customer issue sharing platform. It can be a website, which can display the problems the customers run into recently with detailed description. Technical support people can submit issues to the website, and once an issued which is related to your product is added, the team will receive an email. People can check the issues in category. Every one can make a comment on the issues. We can discuss whether ourselves encountered a problem like that. 
-Let QA engineer know more about the real customer situation in time, so they can find and solve the issues more quickly. It can also help QA engineer make more practical test plans in the further testing. 
-Thanks to the more purposeful testing process, customers can get a reliable product fit for their real product environment.
