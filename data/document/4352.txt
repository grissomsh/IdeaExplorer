Collaboration web portal for CS - India COE

Whenever there is a collab, there is a challenge. 
I figured that I didn't know my own Geo folks. I didn't know who sits 2 bays across where I sit. Which team or who is the WFM/Manager for that team.
If only I'd known, I would have saved so many customer's time.
This is specific to CS team in India COE. We should come up with a collaboration portal that consists of Names of SMEs, Managers, WFMs, Shift times, Queue names for all products. 
Its easier to reach out to people who are available locally.
This helps when customers have opened an SR with one product and is also looking for help on another related product.
