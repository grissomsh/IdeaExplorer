Employee Led Community Project
Increasing the number of diverse touches an employee has will positively increase their ability to bring greater compassion, empathy, perspective and ultimately innovation to a problem.
This idea was the product of a PSRC (Kristen, Pascale, Tania Ward, Piyal Biswas,and Nazira Carlage) brainstorming session.
Design a full day workshop designed to bring employees together to solve common problems.  The workshop will begin with all participants meeting in a single location. Employees will be given a challenge, something that is universal to everyone. Then employees will break up into pre-determined smaller groups. Each smaller group will be constructed so that it includes diverse representation. Group size should be about 8 and should contain only one member per BU.  The format for the workshop should be kept loose, allowing the teams to work together with little outside interference. The point is to bring together diverse people and allow them to work through their differences to solve a problem together. Require employees to participate in the workshop once every five years. Host several workshops on a single date, with each group working to solve the same problem for that date. At the end of the workshop, all groups come together and present their solutions.  Follow that with a reception!
Implementation of this workshop will improve productivity as employees will gain invaluable experience and perspective working together with diverse people.  This experience will provide new perspective that employees can apply to their own work.
