Headphones for calls and meetings

Due to calls I receive weekly this seemed like a good idea and easy to implement
We have a minimum of one or two meetings per week where we have calls with people from all over the globe. We need to have good quality headphones available that are designed for long calls instead of using our personal headphones which is the healthiest option when you consider the length and frequency of these meetings.
