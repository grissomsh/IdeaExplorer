Cables for Environmental Compliance and Cloud High Density Systems
This idea positions EMC to gain cost leverage not only in regards to the product cost but also in the life cycle management such as Environmental Compliance (LSZH),recycling, also by reducing the size of the wire, gains are made in rack depth, air flow, l
Mike and Mick developed this idea 3 years ago to combat environmental legislations and rack space requirements at that time the implementation of this idea was a challenge due to 40% cost increase.  Since then process techniques and new materials have brought the cost down to slightly above par.  At the present time we have tested and qualified cables.  
-This solution positions EMC to take market share by, lowering cable cost, reducing weight(~50%)/shipping cost, reducing space needs in the rack, increasing air flow, easier cable routing, cables will be "Green" NO PVC Phthalates Halogens.  The solution will be LSZH fine gage wire in the high speed space, LSZH power cords, and LSZH optical fiber.  
If this idea were implemented which it could be now, it would reduce shipping weight in current products as well as future products, make cables compliant/bypass various environmental legislations, cable would look exactly as they are now except thinner,
