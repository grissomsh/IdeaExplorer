Bring Your Kids To Work Day 

Ideation session


For one day of the year, employees are allowed to bring their kids to the office. They will be allowed to shadow their parent for the day and see how their job is like. This can be a great bonding oppurunity for the parents, as well as a fun time for the family. In addition, this can be used as a good opportunity to educate a new generation to some advanced concepts such as the 3rd platform and cloud computing, which they can decide to pursue later in their education, and maybe even join the company afterwards!
