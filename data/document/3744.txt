EduWorld - SaaS Offering for Educational Institutions

Personally experienced while studying in one of the premier educational institutes of country and was surprised with unpreparedness of even these premier institutes. 
Proposal is for SaaS offering to offer one-stop-shop for all educational needs of educational institutions. EMC with it's cloud strategy - involving storage, SaaS platform and Content management expertise is in unique position to offer SaaS solution for Education vertical.

Some dimensions of the proposed offering are as below:
1. Assignments, quizzes and other aspects of education are getting digitized resulting in lot of digital content being created year on year - Elastic storage would help institutes pay for only what they use
2. Assignments, Quiz answer sheets need to be retained for a period of at-least 5 years for audit and regulatory reasons - Retention Management
3. Plagiarism in thesis and assignments is another menace which institutes need to deal with - Full text search and Content Analytics would help us curb the menace of Plagiarism. 
4. Collaboration among students, discussion threads are increasingly getting done on digital platforms like online groups, discussion forums - Online collaboration features 
5. Teaching material like Case-studies, technical journals are Intellectual Property and needs to be protected for un-authorized circulation, re-printing etc. - Intellectual Property Management

Offering could be offered both on Private cloud, Public cloud or Hybrid cloud.
