A rewards and recognition(R&R) session dedicated for each BU.

Every team will have a lot of resources who contribute in many ways. Of course there are awards such as MVP to recognize them but only one person is nominated. 

The idea is not to award employees on a regular basis but rather to recognize their efforts with a dedicated session.
A few such nominations for R&R can be:

1) For an employee who has proactively conducted sessions in order to help his colleagues/freshers understand the product better. (Eg: Classroom and BrownBag sessions)

2) For an employee sharing knowledge all the time (Eg: via emails and consult)

The nomination cannot be specific but the idea is to recognize and reward them with something as simple as an applause.

We are sure this happens on a regular basis, but having a dedicated day just for this purpose will motivate them to continue and contribute more to the team and therefore to the organization.
