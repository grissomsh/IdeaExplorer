1.Roll out EMC education program for students(Mostly Comp/IT/Electronics) who are studying in engineering colleges.
2.Improve awareness of skill-sets which are related to EMC.
3.As college has mixed diversity in the stream that is related to EMC, this will create an opportunity to hire good male,physically challenged individuals & female candidates which will help to achieve our diversity criteria.
4.Course might be online or can be delivered in colleges directly.
