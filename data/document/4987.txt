Tracking shipments and part arrival or retainment

In an ideation session discussing that logistics have parts that get lost and that we are unable to pinpoint what happened to those parts.
whenever a Debrief (part replacement) or a new SO shipment takes place the parts should be scanned at location when delivered (if it's a SO shipment) or installed and replaced. 

How it works:
- i'm thinking of a technology like firefly from amazon that relies on SAP and Install Base for it's data
- add a gps pointer on the scanner so that the location is recognized and linked.
- t's a smart scanner that recognizes barcodes or the pictures of items and gives the option of taking actions from there -- the part has been installed --- replaced with another --- returned defective
- as a fist stage we need to have the scanner working for all CEs and the delivery teams so the parts are tracked on their locations regularly during their shipment

- the second stage will be to deploy the system to our customers if they perform the moves,replacements and installation themselves so we can get updated without causing a hassle on their end. they will only need to scan the racks and the new location.
- the process can be automated as a whole and will help get us an accurate data about what's happening with the all EMC sold products.

conclusion:

CE will only need to scan the parts and select the action taken or scan them and send them to the install base or logistics.
We will have a very accurate tracking system for shipments and small parts that get lost or misplaced and are actually installed at different customers or locations than reflected in our database
the system will save man hours wasted on updating the IB as well as fixing the data and updating the Debriefed parts.
