Project Roadmap online portal
Roadmaps are currently layed out as a powerpoint presentation and act as a guide for upcoming projects. The idea/challenge is to create an interface which ties the roadmap to the daptive account and project colleratal docs. Having this as a living identity, allows for better colaboration and project visiblity. This will also tie into equipment/resource planning.
I came up with this idea during an innovation brainstorming session held by team earlier today.
The solution keeps the roadmap in sync/living with the project lifecycle. It's unique because it will provided a central location for all support docs for a project tied to a project reference in daptiv and linked back to the the roadmap. single pain of glass for projects. 
success company would save money, this would improve the current roadmap process and improve cross-funtional interaction in this process.
