Better Way to Avoid the Security Violation within EMC PCs

China COE has taken serious actions to handle with security violation. So I does not want to be recorded with any security violation events. But unfortunately there is no easy tool/service to help on this. As a result, this paint-point gives a chance for this idea.
This kind of tool should
1. be running on PCs as daemon.
2. only monitor any installation activities (invoked by user or virus?.
3. prompt warning messages when detect bad smell.
4. update the un-authorized & illegal software list automatically.

Does it look like “360 ????”? :)
