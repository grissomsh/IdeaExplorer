SmartBand that attaches to Smart Watch for secure and usable user authentication
User authentication today is broken; it’s insecure and unusable.  Furthermore general purpose devices always have vulnerabilities.  The SmartBand is novel, easy to use, inexpensive, secure because it is not a general purpose computer, and can be naturally
The idea was a result of discussion regarding security products in the smart watch space. Mahadevan Vasudevan, Radia Perlman and Xuan Tang were involved in the ideation. Since then we have filed a patent on the idea, had design discussions and worked on various use-cases.
All the users secrets (usernames/pwds, private keys) should be stored in the cloud, encrypted with one really good password.  People can remember and type one good password if there is only one. If this information is downloaded into a general purpose device (such as an iphone), it will be insecure because such devices are complex, subject to vulnerabilities, and users download potentially malicious apps. The SmartBand will serve only one function; to provide user authentication.  It can leverage some capabilities of a smart watch (such as wireless connectivity) to minimize cost without affecting security. The user will initialize the band with credentials, and then a website will provide the option of “authenticate with SmartBand”, in which case a protocol will request credentials from the band, and it will display to the user what is being requested, ask for a simple “OK” with a button, and if the user OK’s, then authenticate on behalf of the user.
With the advent of smart watches and the several apps that require authentication, a reliable low-cost secure device that can interact with the smart wearables is evident. This can prove to be the next flagship product in the smart devices space. This wou
