Monitor EMC storage equipment on mobile deveices
The EMC storage equipment normally be monitored by monitoring software which running on a computer, a user won't know the issues on equipment only if he/she checks the alarms on monitoring software. So a quicker way need to apply to answer the emergence issue on equipment.
I thought that if there's a quick way to limit the time of resolving equipment issue as I met the situation that I used a storage array to do some testing and met a equipment issue need lad admin to address, the lab admin won't go to fix the issue(he possible even doesn't know the issue) until I filed a lab ticked. 
Monitor storage equipment on mobile devices, push a notification to mobile device once the equipment met some problem, and a task will be generated on monitoring system for resolving problem. there're would be two kinds of user who can use the monitoring system.  supervisor and administrator, they will be noticed the issue in time by keeping the mobile device. and the supervisor could assign the task to a specific administrator. The monitor system on mobile device only provider functions to retrieve the metrics of equipment, so at the same time, the administrator could view the metrics on mobile device and figure out solution.
Once the idea is implemented, the lab administrators will be easy to know the status of equipment at any time and take response quickly, so user won't have to waste the time between a issue occurred and filing a lab ticket.
