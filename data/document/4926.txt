Develop an in house app where all EMC federation employees can register with their technical skills (Cloud, Big Data, mobile, security) and with their self rating. This system works on the ranking based. All individuals will quote their rate in internal currency (something like EMC $). There will be a conversion factor from EMC $ to actual $ value. This is somewhat similar to Guru.com & odesk.com sites.

Apart from question posting, skilled professionals can be called directly to solve a particular issue. In this way complex customer issues will be resolved in a quicker fashion.
