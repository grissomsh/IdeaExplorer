Automated Cafeteria Application 
This is an automated process that will allow an ease of reserving meals and pick up of meals. 
Cafeteria owner was asking for suggestions and going around with a paper and a pen asking. Employees miss reserving their favorite meals due to being stuck in a meeting or work. 
Create an application that lists the fresh food available everyday in the cafeteria and allow employees to order and reserve the plates they need.
This will be linked to the cafeteria where employees can view, prepare and reserve the order for EMC staff and will be able to set the pick time exactly. 
Employees can aslo suggest food for the next week for cafeteria owner. 
EMC employees will not waste time asking cafeteria staff to reserve food for them and wait again till it is heated.
Even if you are stuck in a meeting or work, you will be able to reserve what you want. 
Food will not be finished before employees get a chance to reserve what they need.
