CLI to Voice Bridge

Just a radical thought. Possibly subconsciously influenced by Google's Voice activated Search Engine. ;-) This could probably be a step towards a peek into futuristic technology. The edge over our competition relies on what tasks are automated and triggered by certain voice activated commands.

We could innovate and take it a step further by also integrating smart-phone menus or tablet or Phone IVR based 
Tasks dependent on CLI commands could be consolidated with scripts on various platforms and triggered by voice commands.

The ability to switch between various input methods (keyboard vs. voice) would be task dependent.

We have been using the same method (CLI access) of interacting with computers for decades. Its time to innovate!!!
