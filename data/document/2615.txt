Medusa BBU Transfer (Data Domain)
The challenge is with the material transferring from Flextronics to various EMC locations and to improve delivery, reduce cost and look at various manufacturing options.  As we are aware a number of challenges exist with transportation and handling of Lit
When Apex SBMT looked at the various components involved with the transfer of material from Flextronics, it was noted that the Medusa and the CoPilot BBU are the same size and appear the same with the exception of the metal face plate.  This has been discussed with Component Engineering in Franklin but no resolution to date.
Completed Medusa BBU consists of few parts and could easily be assembled by various manufactures. Currently Engineering is qualifying a new supplier which is outside of the existing supply base and a qualified supplier already exists.  Assembling the BBU at AcBel or closer to final assembly area would reduce cost as well as delivery time and the need for extra material on hand to cover EOQ demand.  In addition with AcBel on site, the reverse logistics and the failure analysis process are already established.
AcBel would be qualified as the primary supplier and reduce the supply base as well as having reverse logistics and failure analysis process already in place in Apex.  Assembling the BBU at AcBel, qualified for CoPilot BBU, or closer to the final assembly
