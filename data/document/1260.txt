Core Technologies Cross-Product Quality Engineering Team
This idea improves the supportability of the Core Technologies portfolio by assigning specific resources to collaborate and co-work on offerings consisting of multiple Core Technologies products – a small and focused quality engineering team consisting of subject matter experts from each product team.  Structuring a specific team responsible for validating product interactions will be more efficient and effective than current ad hoc efforts.
This proposal was generated during an ideation session at the Ireland COE involving personnel from VMAX, VNX, and Customer Service.
This idea solves the problem by directly assigning resources to a cross-functional team who are co-located, with appropriate equipment and lab space.  This enables better collaboration and focus on cross-product offerings as compared to today’s approach where main responsibility lands with the consumer.  Having each product group provide subject matter experts in support of this effort is unique.

WHAT - Cross-product solutions testing in a holistic manner, such as VMAX + Data Domain (ProtectPoint), VMAX + XtremIO (FTS)
WHY - Existing solution testing is done on an ad hoc basis, and focused experts working together will provide an optimized and higher quality test & validation capability to benefit EMC & customers
WHO - Two quality engineers from each of the main CTD products, including; VMAX, Data Domain, XtremIO, VNX/VNXe
WHERE - Co-located with adequate lab space & physical equipment, most likely Durham and/or Cork
WHEN - Ramp team within a quarter with aim to be fully staffed within six months
HOW - Through support of Core Technologies leadership, leveraging product expertise from the assigned subject matter experts, with defined metrics to quantify impact and/or areas to adjust
Success will be the team of assigned subject matter experts in place and responsible for the cross-product testing, providing a greater and more complete test capability when Core Technologies products are integrated in each other, resulting in higher customer satisfaction and lower support cost.  The team is to be self-funded within Core Technologies via a pooling of some existing personnel & equipment from each product team.

Key outputs:
to product groups - test reports & flagging of compatibility issues
to Customer Service - error reporting & problem isolation guidance
to Professional Services - implementation guidance & usage guidance
to Product Management - deeper understanding of end-user experience
