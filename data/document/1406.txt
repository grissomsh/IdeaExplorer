Peer Review 
This idea will enhance communication skills between employees.
I always wondered if i had good communication skills with my colleagues and how they see my performance from their perspective.
My idea is to do a survey each quarter for each employee to be filled by his peers but it will be anonymous , so that each employee can know his point of strengths and weakness in terms of communication skills with his peers.
1-Allow peers to evaluate each other.
2-Improve communication skills for each employee between his peers.
