VSD only Services (Residency and Implementation)
Considering the current controls to recover costs and manage spending in EMEA region, creating a clear service offering with VSD only should contribute positively on the overall revenues towards multiple regions and attract more customer with spending brackets that are below the average cost of an onsite/local FTE while maintaining better quality and more consistency in the delivery model.  and support a speedy growth of VSD contribution for PS global delivery.
Based on my experience leading VSD residency in Cairo, there is much potential with mid market customers and even enterprise when it comes to residency services specially the conservative spenders. from VSD business development perspective, I concluded multiple meetings with Solution principles in EMEA (UK, Germany, UAE, France...) to introduce such service, yet it would require a sponsor to incubate the initiative and finally conclude the market analysis for such segment and address it to the fit the market needs. and to take advantage of the diverse and wide range of skills VSD 
If we can produce a standard SoW for such sector that should be perfect to attract such conservative customer budgets yet would also provide them with EMC's world class service levels. assigning a VSD PM (part time and maybe a SAM) to handle such production environments will support EMC's growth plans towards VSD's contribution to professional services and grant EMC much bigger market share in the services field while maintaining the margin percentages and maybe allow increase margins.
If my idea finally was incubated and implemented I would only assume high growth in EMC services market share which should lead to more product/solution sales and increase the VSD contribution and finally reflect positively on the country/region's P&L. this should best position EMC products and services sales.
