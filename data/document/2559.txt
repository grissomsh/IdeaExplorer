Binfile Category Code
It lets us better understand what problems are occurring on the products with certain configurations.
It can give us leads to improve TCE, our products and the way we service our products. 
When failures occur on a product, there can be so many failure types that we need an Error Code to distinguish between them. e.g. For VMAX 208.0480.73 - From this we know it was a power supply issue in the Disk Array Enclosure. 
The idea is to also categorize the different type of binfiles/configuration we have on the boxes into Code and include this in Dialhome files and RMA/SPcollect log files (data collection files on failures).
Talking to many teams from Engineering, Quality, SPL and Customer Support teams, they have these problems.
It gives us the capability to summarize the customer's product's configuration which we had not done before.
SYR canned Queries which are currently used to collect S/Ns with particular configurations are limited and complicated to create.  
Even with this Canned Query result, we are unsure if it matches the configuration at the time the SR was created.


1) Ability to run queries & correlate other data associated with particular Binfile types
2) Understand how products are reacting in the customer's environment when set up with certain configurations
3) Can run queries that match specific configurations
