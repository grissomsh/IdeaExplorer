Improving quality of Customer Service.

Whenever we get a CSAT, an email is sent to the whole team lauding them, but if in case it is a DSAT, it is not shared because of obvious ethical code. However, since every DSAT is an opportunity to learn, we feel that this learning should be made available to everyone. 
Over a quarterly or monthly basis the cumulative DSATs and CSATs would be analyzed, both at a technical standpoint and a soft-skill standpoint. 

The outcome of this analysis will be used in a review session for the entire team to talk about and learn from that month's or quarter's surveys. 

This will be a platform for both setting up best practices and also improvising ideas which are already in place.
