Software Defined Network Data Centre in EOS2 Lab
1.Administration, Management & Maintenance of the Network will be improved 
2.Allows IT departments to incrementally implement virtual networks at whatever pace they choose (without impact to existing applications and network configurations)

In lab, currently it takes 14 working days to get the new network/VLAN creation and 14 working days to reconfigure the changes in the firewall, with VMware NSX
Network provisioning/reconfiguration time reduced from days to mins.
Network Virtualization can be incorporated across the existing lab environment using the SDN Software-VMware NSX
1.Cost savings in terms of procuring physical and expensive routers/firewalls
2.Automated network provisioning
3.Multi-Tenant Networks
4. Also easier to perform the changes in the existing network configuration
5. capex/opex savings in managing physical network infra (routers/firewalls)
