Customer Configurations - https://inside.emc.com/ideas/3280
The goal is to develop a universal approach for characterizing how an array is used, which can be used at both customer sites and in the test lab, to better align our test efforts with customer expectations. 
During EMC Big Data Day 2014, this Business Value case was selected as 1 of 3 workshop value cases for the event.  Since then, development has begun with a cross-functional team of IT, EOSS, and Engineering.  The idea has been developed, data ingestion and analysis for hardware configuration completed, with a first pass around visualization and end user review all completed.  There are an additional 7 signatures to be developed and will require on-going resources and/or funding.
With the proliferation of Big Data, cross function team of IT, EOSS and Engineering (joining the "business" and "technical" teams) along with parsing of data that has not been analyzed prior to this project, provides new insight into how to test and develop products.  This solution includes using ECPS and Greenplum DBs to review structured and unstructured data.  Data sources include SYR, SR/CSI, SPCollects, NAR, GDW, TCE, CQ, IB and other data sets as required to provide a complete dimension visualization.  This project is drinking our own champagne, using best of breed tools (Tableau, GP, Hadoop), and providing an agile approach to managing the project.

The visualizations can provide short term (under 12 month) results as well as provide baseline data to be ingested into the IT Business Data Lake (BDL) benefiting various engineering teams.
Success would include eliminating tests that are no longer utilized by customers configurations, add testing for configurations previously not tested, and discovery around new relational affects across  configurations.
