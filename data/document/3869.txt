Leveraging External Employee Networks

Idea generated during a Womenâ€™s Leadership Forum  (WLF) Cork Chapter IGS in <site name(s)>. As the WLF  membership in Cork is very cross functional, we got  together as a group to see how we could bring that  variety of perspective to the challenges and had some  fun in the process.
A system that will allow employees to publish there past work history/past clients that they chose to share and is associated with their profile on Inside EMC. Sales could review this to identify if there are any existing relationships they could leverage or if there is any knowledge an employee may have that can help a sales proposal gain that 'competitive edge' through contextual knowledge.
