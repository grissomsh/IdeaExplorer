Digitize your culture though EMC community
Our idea helps a user realize the dream of digitizing a cultural heritage, could be a document,manuscript,image with the help of people within EMC. Our idea helps in creating a platform that can involve the requester and contributors to help achieve this goal. Our proposal involves using an app that communicates and leverages the platform to help digitize.
We stared discussing on this idea from the innovation challenges. We were interested in this because a solution to this problem could help solve or promote other crowd source projects.
Our idea is not around just giving a means digitize  a cultural artifact such as a document or image.It is around managing workloads efficiently and distributing the work in a crowd source model. The requester also gets to see the progress of his request and promote his project to others in the community.

An enticing presentation on this is available @ https://inside.emc.com/docs/DOC-154725 

If the idea is implemented, you could have a community of users with an app through which they will be able to submit/promote a request for a digitization project and with a click of a button a community could get involved in an exciting digitizing project whcih would give a chance to preserve and share the culture they are part of.
