EMC Sustineo

i am submitting an idea against -Employee Engagement: Create an idea to inspire and influence more than 25% of EMC employees to actively participate in Sustineo <link: http://emc.practicallygreen.com/>.

i am the only person involved in this idea
We can encourage employees to participate in Sustineo by organizing Rewards & Recognition.
If the employees get adequate recognition it will definitely help them to achieve more. It is also a motivation factor.
This will influence & encourage the employees to participate in Green initiatives & also participate in Sustineo.
There are lots of employees who actively participate in EMC Sustainability activities who go unnoticed.
If these unnoticed people are made to actively update their achievementsâ€™ in Sustineo  link , it will make a greater impact.
I think that few employees have limited knowledge on how Sustineo can help them change the environment around us.
Recycled materials can be awarded to the employees who make a mark or score more points.
Example for awards : Hand bags, water bottles, Travel mugs & bicycles. These are reusable & have less impact on the environment.
