Vipr Controls

-
Ammend to Vipr an interface that generates code to be integrated in customer websites.
From this code, certain embedded controls can be used where users submit their requests. 
The requests flows to the administrator. Once approved the implementation of the request is automatically done with vipr. 

Automating the whole request process would fasten the process and make it less prune to human error.
