Room Lighting 
I feel this idea is related to the challenge as it looks at the workplace of the future and what should EMC do to reduce carbon emissions. 
I came up with this idea while currently based in the Ovens location and the windows are tinted so no natural lights gets into the building.  This also have a significant impact of my eyes when I then go outside. 
I propose that EMC, especially the Ovens location should incorporate more natural lighting into the offices. Also, I propose additional lighting around employees desk to prevent the glare on screens. 
I think this would benefit employees as they would have improved lighting which would put less strain on employees eye sight, which might reduce EMC health care costs.  Additionally, using more natural light would reduce EMC electrical costs and also helping the environment.
