Unified communication using Lync with integration of Cisco telepresence

Being part of global professional services we require interacting with our onsite counter parts/clients in different time zone hence it difficult to attend the telepresence meetings and also most of the time we might need to attend the meeting during transit.
Hence we come up with an idea of integrating Lync with Cisco Immersive telepresence which will address above said problem and also increase productivity.

Using CISCO immersive telepresence solution it can be used to make/receive calls from Lync for multipurpose telepresence system. CISCO immersive telepresence endpoint appears to Lync like any other endpoint; equally, to CISCO immersive telepresence endpoint a Lync client is just another video endpoint.
Cisco Immersive Telepresence solution has some additional functionality which provides the industry’s best integration between Lync and an Immersive Telepresence system. When a Lync client is connected to the Cisco Immersive Telepresence solution, the Lync user is not treated as a “second class” participant in the conference: the Lync user sees all other members of the conference Virtual Tele presence for Lync 2013
A critical element to the Cisco Immersive Telepresence solution is the Cisco Telepresence Server. This is an application-specific MCU for Immersive three-screen TelePresence that provides the industry’s most robust offering for multipoint TelePresence conferencing and interoperability. 
The Cisco architecture for integrating from VCS to Lync Server via a SIP trunk makes it easy to add the Cisco Immersive TelePresence solution (Multipurpose Telepresence and the Telepresence Server) to a Lync Server environment.
