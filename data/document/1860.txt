A Day of Silence
It's a novel idea that could well form the basis of a contemporary workplace.
It takes away distractions and will improve the workload and work/life balance.
This was raised as part of the Ireland IT Idea Generation Session lead by Darren O'Keeffe.
A specific day set aside where no one could set any meetings, no one could stop by another persons desk or even talk to them.
It allows the individual to focus and concentrate on their work backlog

I could see major productivity improvements in this. People always have a work backlog and by using this idea that could be eradicated in one day. No distractions, no annoying meetings, it may mean that person doesn't have to login when they get home to complete their days work, this leads to a better work/life balance for that person
