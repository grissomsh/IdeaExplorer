Use VNX ( also Other) Serial Number to create ESRS SR when ESRS SN is not available on CST Tool
Currently we are creating ESRS SR with SN if it is available on CST Tool, if the SERS SN is not available we create the SR using the Party Id. if we use the VNX SN if it is available on CST Tool.  we can make ASE (our Customer) job easy  and meaningful
Since we started this process we are creating ESRS SR and when we create SR without SN, ASE's will come back and say that they won't be able to clock their time on WFM, in such cases neither the SR will have any value nor the ASE will use the SR which has no SN. and some of the ASE's are requesting us to create the ESRS SR with VNX SN we are already creating the SR for those request. I have cross checked with some of the ASE's on this issue, on the ESRS SN absence if we can create the SR with other SN like VNX Serial number there will be no technical issue and it will be useful for them to reflect their hours on EAS.
If the CST Tool (where we get the serial number)not updated with ESRS SN and having updated with VNX (Also we can use other SN like Switch, Avamar, Data Domain...,SN if its ok to use),to create the SR. its always better and the SR will useful compares to creating SR with Party Id on SN absence. because ASE can work on it and they can clock their time, also we can avoid unnecessary email conversations and escalations on this.
If we create the ESRS SR with VNX SN it will very much useful for ASE from his job point. as well as here by the effort that we are putting on this job will make more sense, by avoiding escalations and follow up emails we can save lot of our valuable time
