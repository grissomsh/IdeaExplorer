HR Challenge - Diversity and Innovation at a Great Place to Work.
My Idea is how existing diversity in EMC can be cultured to bring Innovation

This is new idea.

My solution involves a unique way to build a global diverse team using existing framework of EMC.Process involves Debate,group discussion,essay writing on diverse topics meant for expressing technical,business know how and creativity.
The team so created will have a competent review committee and will have a list of goals and priorities leading to measurement of its effectiveness.This team will also have less dependency on the middle management,and accountibility lies with R&D directors.The process makes use of Inside EMC portal for organising above mentioned activities and also to identify excellent mentors through existing training programs.A flow chart describing the process is also attached in Inside_EMC portal, "Innovation Roadmap".(https://inside.emc.com/docs/DOC-155677).

If the idea is successfully implemented, we will have a global diverse force who will present ideas on new products ,new features in exsisting product,understand market compititiveness, attract top talent in the industry,retain top performers.
Company will be benefited with new competitive/innovative products in the market and also with technical patents.
