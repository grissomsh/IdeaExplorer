Unified Workforce
My idea is to build a global knowledge resource database that we can consult at any time. The resources will be any available member of our staff that falls into specific categories. so around the globe we can help each other and solve the customer issues
This idea appears when some issue stays in investigation state for too long.

I put myself on our customer shoes and they want us to solve the issue as fast as we can.So my putting more resources with different skill level we can solve the issues and learn more from each other.
So by posting the issue to a  big crowd maybe someone is an expert in that subject and help us to solve the issue.Or faced same issue in the past and can help us.

This could be an internal forum that we post the idea and colleagues can answer or provide guidance.
The benefits would be customer more satisfied with EMc support and products and improvement of skills for everyone
