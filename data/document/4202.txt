Direct contact access to support for the second time callers

Many a times we have spent too much time on phone, selecting IVR options and speaking to many people for getting an engineer to work on the critical issue. We would be informed saying engineer would be assigned in 30mins and you will get a call back, but that hardly happens and we end up following the same process to chase up, in turn spending too much time on phone.

Having a direct contact to the team who can review the case and analyze the criticality of the issue, and work with customer end to end, until an engineer is assigned to work on the critical issues. This team should have e-mail DL and direct contact number with very minimum IVR options so that customer can reach out immediately.
