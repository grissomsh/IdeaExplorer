EMC's own hybrid cloud in production
This idea is for CTO office's challenge regard new business. Since EMC have the best storage product and best security technology, why EMC don't run it's own Hybrid cloud to provide service to public. 
For a long time, there are discussion over public cloud and hybrid cloud, and we know AWS runs quite well for few years, however there is no real hybrid cloud service in production, there is no solidate proof that hybrid cloud have more advantage than public cloud. Once we have the hybrid cloud service open to public, this definitely helps to show the industry the advantage of hybrid cloud.
My idea is to setup EMC's own hybrid cloud by leveraging our EHC technology, and provide the cloud service to our external customer and internal customer. As far as i know, there is no real hybrid cloud in production in the industry, if EMC have this cloud service, it would be a big step of hybrid cloud and will bring extra revenue.
Once the EMC hybrid cloud is in production, it will bring extra revenue to our company and it makes EMC a real solution (cloud) company rather than the traditional HW manufacture. And it will show the industry the hybrid cloud's real power.
