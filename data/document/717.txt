Elevator Balancing
this idea will effect electricity which will lead to less cost
Brainstorming
we have 4 elevator; assign 2 elevators (A&B) for levels "2-4-6" and 2 elevators (C&D) for levels "1-3-5".
Any employee in level 2 can only use (A or B) for example.

That will balance the use a little bit and it 
Less Cost.
Saving Employees valuable time
