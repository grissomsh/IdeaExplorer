Cross functional surveys should be available for internal teams

We have many instances in our team having a Diss Sat surveys for the reasons that the license team did not provided proper licences in timely manner and the Product team removing the existing features with the new releases
When ever a team raises a case internally with Licensing or Engineering/product and they provide a resolution which did not accepted by the customer. As a result of a CS or any person from any Org unit gets a bad survey then that needs to get cascaded to the responsible teams as well.
