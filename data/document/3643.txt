Social network as a service

People are looking for a safe and secure social network and I was thinking we can start implementing that on a small scale, targeting security That people's information won't be shared on public servers


We can start implementing a small social media for companies specially in emerging countries.

ex: " Oil and gas, banks & Private schools, etc..." 

We are implementing a whole social network based on private cloud for the concerned parties for people to get engaged and share updates with each other, as they do on public social networks.

The idea will encourage people in same company to join the social network together which enhance the communication between parties, also offload the traffic of facebook slightly by time.

We can then start merge social networks together for the companies who are interested to do a partnership
