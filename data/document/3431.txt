EMC Go Green

innovation session
With A small survey we have made within our team we have found that every 1 in 5 people use a wireless mouse. We almost all know how harmful disposing batteries is to the environment. We can make an initiative where EMC can collected the disposed batteries and by the end of each year we would send the batteries to be "separated ". The money EMC would get out of this can be used to sponsor a go green campaign that could run all over Egypt.
