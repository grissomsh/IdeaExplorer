Smart Conference Room Management

While pursuing a MSEM at Tufts University, we had the opportunity to meet with iRobot as part of a Business Strategy research project.  We noticed that they were implementing a smart conference room management system where there was a touch panel outside of each conference room.  The first thought that crossed our minds was, this is a problem that we face at EMC every day and an ideal solution to the CRFF problem.
This solution:
1) Indicates if the room is booked or free 
2) Provides conference room details (ie. room capacity, room features, meeting times/duration, room availability, and an option to book another conference room for your meeting right at that time)
3) Cancels conference room reservations if the room remains idle for an allotted amount of time
4) Integrates with the existing email infrastructure

We are only aware of software solutions where there is a dependency on the owner of the reservation to make updates if necessary.  These updates rarely happen.
