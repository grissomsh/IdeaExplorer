 A new approach towards collaboration

 
The idea came up from participation in an initiative proposed to provide a solutions level support 

•	 Past initiatives relied on a “Pod” concept where multiple groups would sit near each other and share knowledge or work on an issue. With time people would learn how to do some of the tasks the other groups would normally do. This theory works if everyone is in the same room, building, or country. We have evolved due to growth and cost constraints into a virtual team with people in both local and remote locations. We need a way to build up the knowledge without the long term requirement to be in close proximity to each other.
•	Past initiatives treated all types of collaboration the same. However, there are certain groups we collaborate with at a high frequency, moderate frequency and low frequency. Some collaborations are longer and harder to work through. These different groups of collaborations require different Solution Support approaches.  
•	And lastly, previous initiatives tried to make everyone better at collaborating. This is a good approach We believe you need to focus on smaller groups of people to build deeper skills.
