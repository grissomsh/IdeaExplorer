Global Interaction and Involvement

we had a similar challenge collaborating with cross functional teams. that's when we decided, especially to celebrate every milestone. this boosted the confidence and contributions!
A sense of transparency need to be achieved for a global team to function effectively.
Celebrate each and every mile stone, no matter how small it is. Celebrations can be anything ranging from a small get-together, clicking a pic together, highlighting the contributions, awards, mentioning in Newsletters......
Involve the team in Wiki discussions, create a group ( may be Whatsapp, FB, Twitter,....) and  share  what is happening around/with you.
This will create a sense of bonding and oneness among the team.
Not everything need to be taken through official route. "Help and get helped". This works wonder
