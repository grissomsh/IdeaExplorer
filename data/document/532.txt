simplifying the POC stage
Putting in consideration the TCE and how this can improve the customer satisfaction is a major factor to achieve high levels of relationships with our customers.
We already provide control stations for a number of our storage products , some projects get quite complicated because we do not have the option of promoting the platform onto which the core modules of the solution should run , and most of the times the choices left to the customer are made based on misunderstanding and wrong assumptions , developing such deployment option will certainly put much more light on the solution and ease the execution of important project steps 
How it works:
The customer will be made aware that there is a ready to go option for deployment of the server module of the product he wishes to buy / try 
For example :
1-	Networker : A ready to go Server/Storage node platform developed on top of CAP 

2-	DPA : Ready to go DPA server / proxy collector on top of CAP 


Benefits to EMC:-

1- Accelerate the POC process.
2- Simplify the install/implement/ deploy of EMC product " Specially networker"
3- offload the customer of checking the support matrix for our software products.
4- leverage our products' usability and adaptability.
Improved customer satisfaction and ease of deployment.
