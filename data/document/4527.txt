Auto Drive Replacer

As a storage administrator it gets into your nerves when a simple hard-drive replacement takes days to replace. The time taken to co-ordinate with the Field Team and create an Access ticket for the CE to visit the datacenter results in unwanted wastage of time, resources and money.
With the help of ADR, storage admins would not even have to bother about Hard-drive replacements anymore.

Basic Hardware Requirements install ADR:
1. A spare Drive Bay with JBODs (that contain disks of the same part number/capacity as the ones that are already in production)
2. A robotic arm that facilitates drive replacement.

The Auto Drive Replacer can be integrated into the Form Factor of the Storage Array and also into the Flare/Enginuity Code in such a way that, whenever a Hard-Drive fails, a message is sent to the Robotic Arm.
The robotic arm will first verify if the data on the faulty drive has been copied to a hotspare. 
Once verified, it will read the drive partnumber/drive type from the XML files and select an appropriate drive from the Spare Drive Bay.
Finally, the faulty drive is removed from the slot and replaced with a new one.

The software can be built in such a way that 
> It autmatically detects a faulty drive, communicates with the robotic arm and repalces it without human intervention
OR
> It sends a message to the customer/storage admin that the drive has faulted and takes permission from us to initiate a the ADR action sequence.
Either way, the cost and time involved in simple hardware replacements can be significantly reduced.
