Monthly Mini team outings

During the work day I notice that I speak alot to my colleagues but every single work after "Hello" is strictly work related and it appears that sometimes I really don't know the people I work with. 
Simply arranging a monthly outing for the team member (dinner) that would be funded by the company. The outing would be light on work (only important updates if necessary) but it would be more of a social outing with the purpose of letting team members bond and get to know each other. The long term effect of this idea should see a massive improvement in the team work we do together, not to mention that making friends is never a bad idea.
