Introduce an award for Bangalore SMEs who work on KCS - "SME of the Quarter Award"
This award is for the SMEs who are part of CSS. Many of the SMEs are very busy always. Inspite of their busy schedule they still take cases, work on backlog reduction, mentor team members and review articles. We need to motivate SMEs to review more articl
I came up with this idea since I work with authors and SMEs on a daily basis. I felt this could be an area of improvement where we can motivate our SMEs to review more content and reduce backlog in the queues.
Recognition and rewards are the best way to motivate an employee. Our SMEs need more recognition for their hard work!!!
If my idea is implemented it would result in improving the performance and job satisfaction of our SMEs. A recognized SME is a more productive SME!!
