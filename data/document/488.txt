EMC Organic Vegetable/Fruits Stall
I think it is possible with EMC with some care and maintenance.
I have been eating vegetables/fruits which are of no taste and no quality.Some of them caused me different health problems.So i preferred buying Organic food.But these stores are not available everywhere. This is painful and have to eat the same old  food prepared with vegetables/leafs which are contaminated by pesticides.
I feel organization like EMC has taken many initiatives in providing ECO friendly/Go Green can also start an Organic Vegetables/Fruits stall.

The idea is, employ who have passion in growing vegetable plants or fruits can sell their vegetables or fruits here in the EMC stall for some amount of worth.Many of employees are interested in buying it from the stall as it is easy to access.

Its a profitable business to EMC and also encouraging more people to start the organic kitchen gardening and take care of their kitchen waste management.Also we are indirectly supporting Go-Green to the environment.
Success comes to EMC as well as the employee assosiated with when everyone starts accessing it.This may take time but definitely everyone will adopt it.

Benefits are both to Organization and employee:

Good Health
Easy access to buy/sell
Give back to society
