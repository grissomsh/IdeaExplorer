Wonderful Chat Service Experience
This idea is helping improve customer experience by reducing initial response time of Chat cases. This matches the Customer Experience dimension of APJ COE "Solutions Platform" Challenge
Recently, our Avamar support Chat cases volumes are increasing. Due to resource limitation, we only have 2 Chat support work at the same time each day. Sometimes customer could wait for a long time until a chat support has a free hand to help them. This is a very bad experience for customer. This idea is from the real challenge our support teams have been facing each day.
Our solution is adding some new features to Chat services including:

1.	Provide an approximate time how long customer should wait until get a help
2.	Provide an indication how many Chat engineers are working for Chat services at     that moment
3.	Prompt an option to customer to transfer the Chat case to normal queue to follow up if they don't receive a response after 3 or 5 minutes. If customer accept the promotion, Chat system will move the case to normal queue automatically and support team will follow up from that point  

A good chat service is customer should get a help from other way if all chat supports are busy after waiting for some time. For example, after waiting for 3 or 5 minutes, Chat system can prompt customer whether they want to continue waiting for they prefe
