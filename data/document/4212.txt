EMC educational nursery

The educational level of regular nurseries has not exacrly impressed me but at the same time they are very expensive. Also this EMC nursery would spare me the headache of trying to squeeze all my work into a certain amount of time because I need to leave and pick  up my kid from their nursery.
Having a space on premises dedicated for a nursery hosting the children of employees. The nursery would act as a day care center but also with some educational values so that it would also be beneficial for the children and help develop/shape their minds at this very sensetive stage of their life.
