DreamBOX
-DreamBOX mission is to give Customer the power to share their views about their dream products and make the world more open and connected through their dream. 
-DreamBOX content is going be customer desirable information about products, we can leverage the information in such a way that will produce a guidelines to a dream product or solution to customer problem. 
last year I got this idea,sometimes we need products as per our requirement,it can be phone,car,bike etc. So I thought of having a DreamBOX as a social media to connect with people having same requirement/dream about the products.

-Let company use DreamBOX  to stay connected with customer and let them find ways to experiment with bringing them into reality over time.

DreamBOX will have a user friendly GUI. 

-Text box, sketching and drawing sheet, Doodling option.(When it comes to creativity and innovation we need the power of visualization, sketching, drawing, the power of doodling)
-Dream categories. 
-Dream view option to see others dream for same categories. 
-Tagging option to interact with other dreamer, no friend request required, tagging is important(To talk to people about your dream/wishes and action items).

-This would be a different level of customer engagement, let organization know about below points through Dream BOX.
