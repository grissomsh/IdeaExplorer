Portable EHC Management
With this solution, EHC management will be more efficient. And it will reduce the cost of management for EHC too.
We are using portable devices every day, there are many APPs on it. These APPs make our life more convenient than before. We can use the technology to our EHC.
Considering the limited screen of the portable devices, the GUI of this APP should be very easy, and only the very base operations should be supported on it. 
For example:
- User A want a new windows VM with IP as 10.247.101.11, then A send a request to admin B. 
- But B is on the way home, so B opens portable EHC management APP on his mobile phone.
- Find the proper datastore and OS then input the IP and some other necessary information and save.
- The request will be sent to B's manager C for approval with email&short message
- Then C open the same APP and found there is a request need be approved, and he approved it. And the setting up of VM is triggered automatally.
- B got the email&short message that the VM created.
- B send a message or email to A, VM is ready.
With this solution, EHC management will be more easy to use. The management cost will be reduced too.
