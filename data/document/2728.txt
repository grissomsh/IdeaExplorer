Enhancing the overall process for case handling inside support department.
As a support engineer, we are having daily conversation with WFMs when we are trying to know about handling something specific such as owner changing or case dispatching.
-Having a best practice guide for case handling among WFM and TSEs would make it efficient.
-Engineers would know where to look for specific things instead of asking WFMs and wait for their response.

-Saving time and effort for both WFMs and TSEs
-Making it easier to handle the support cases.
-Meet SLO of support cases.
-Enhance overall process will reflect positively.
