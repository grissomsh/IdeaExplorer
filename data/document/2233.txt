Testing VM auto deployment
It can simplify the management process and reduce manual work.
I have VM's not used for a month for the project arrangement(VM have FC connection to BC array, but no BC releases currently.). I don't want to release the VM, because I have to find another VM and do the FC configuration once the BC release coming.
If the VM deployment and FC configuration could be completed automatically, I don't have to keep the VM reservation for now.
Create a website/APP allow user to deploy VM as user specified.
Such as: VM type, subnet, storage/memory size .etc
And user could choose how long will the VM used. When the time comes, VM could be destroyed automatically.
Also, VM could be monitored during the process, if no activity in long time, notify user and destroy VM later.
Load balance in a short term.
Reduce the manual work of VM deployment.
Save the storage resource.
Simplify the VM managment process.
