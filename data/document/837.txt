Analytics-as-a-service using ViPR
Our idea is to provide analytics-as-a-service (AaaS) using ViPR as a storage management tool across EMC products. This would provides infinite analytical capabilities like - analyze common patterns in failure, prediction of failures, view QoS parameters and tune the products better to meet the requirements etc.

Big Data analytics
Our solution uses ViPR Controller as an integrated enterprise storage management tool across EMC products for data mining using call home data and provides AaaS.

* Most of our product support some form of call home mechanism. We extend this to automatically send product related information to the public cloud hosted by EMC periodically.

* The product information will be restricted by the size of data that gets transmitted to our cloud

* The data would be parsed and stored in an object store 

* For data analysis we use existing Pivotal solutions for our analytical engine

* We  would expose REST based web services to the clients via ViPR. 

* Customer pays for the services he uses and initiates analysis request in ViPR. 

* Web server would  handle the client requests. It in-turn invoke the analytics engine which fetches the data from the object store and processes the request. 

* The response will be in the form of JSON. 

* ViPR generates the data representation in the form of graphs, reports, dashboards and provide corrective measures if applicable.

*Generates alternate sources of revenue by selling AaaS

*Make ViPR de facto standard for storage management across EMC products there by increasing the user 
Experience

* Since we would be having a repository of product information, we can use it for data mining operations like failure prediction, perform signature based pattern analysis, isolate bottle neck etc

*Using 3rd platform, EMC will have a strong footprint in providing analytics-as-a-service
