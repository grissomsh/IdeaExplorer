SAP E-Software Day-32 PVal Report

The idea came about after a few EOQ's & Day 32 activities. There is a desire to close the prior quarter properly and efficiently. 
This new tool will list out the Sale of PVAL info as well as any changes that have been made to the initial sales order. With these exceptions noted; the reconciliation can be done much more efficiently.
