Diversity And Innovation Committee  (DIC)
Diversity and Innovation both words are important factor for EMC And enhance Great Place to work for higher level.As Diversity is consider as main part of any Innovation
I was part of GPTW Committee for CST last year 2014, and got some comment from Employees about some issue related Diversity,and when saw this challenge i got this idea to form this new committe
Idea is to form new Committee named Diversity and Innovation Committee,
This committee has responsibility to provide EMC Employee various types of diversity training (Instructor Led, Online Course, classes and workshop).
During training Employee will educate each other about different culture, Gender, origin Race/color, age, Nationality and Sexual orientation
that will give EMC Employee a full understanding of the workplace around him
this idea will gain a main goal for EMC To build the workplace more diverse and becoming top 10 Global diversity Employer and go forward to top of the list into Global Great Place to work.
for Employee will assist him to be more diversity in thinking and for sure innovate.
