This idea will help Employees to select what training to involve in.

My Solution is to add the courses that is provided each quarter on the education website , where employees that had attended that course can leave a feedback about it that can each other employee that want to involve in the same course can decide whether to enroll or not.
will help the Employees to select the relevant training according to their interest and know feedback of other employees about that course.
