Fire Safety Compliance - Fire Risk Reducer (FRR)

In the recent past a fire incident in a hospital in Kolkata, India took away many lives. On investigation few things got observed, among which most critical was the human behaviour on such demanding situation that miserably failed due to lack of precautionary measures taken by the hospital as Fire safety Compliance.
During Fire it is analysed that 99% time people fail to keep their nerve cool, which leads to panic state and to save their life they take hasty decision that causes more casualty.In 80-85% fire accident, it is observed that causalty happens due to negligence and reluctant behaviour of the facility in providing preventive measures. 3 most critical preventive measures as follows;

Reducing chances of stampede - During construction, Architect should plan for keeping Ramp at the Exit instead of stairs.

No Push/Pull Exit doors - All exit doors should be made up of plastic or glasses and work as "Swing Door(both ways)" and would always get open with the fire or smoke alarm. People should not think on Push or Pull during fire.

Luminous Paint -  Luminescent or phosphorescence paint should be used to mark arrows at Exit Ramp or Entry stairs inside the building. This would certainly help people to see in the dark and smoke.
