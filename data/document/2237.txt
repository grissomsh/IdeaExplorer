Provide individual work lamp to each employee's station
In Chengdu COE, the brightness of the lights is too high, its direct radial impact the readability of the monitors and tires employees' eyes.
I feel my eyes so tired in daily work, because of the high brightness lights in Chendgu CoE office.
1. Provide individual lamp to each employee's station.
2. Turn off some lights in the public areas, keep some necessary light for the hall, WC etc. 
Sure it could make money saved on electricity cost. because employees will turn on their own lamps when they are working, we could avoid the case of keeping large number lights on for just one or a few people.
