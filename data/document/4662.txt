Capacity Management as a Service

Conduct a poll of SEs and AEs on how many of their accounts do capacity managment, do it well, and are happy with it, and some will perhaps have 1 account, most will have 0.  I am constantly asked by my accounts about usage trends, even the ones that have tools like SRM and DPA - today I was queried for the 5th time in a month.  When customers are overwhelmed with operational requests, migrations, and code updates, longer term projects like capacity management fall by the wayside for more urgent tasks.  Customers struggle to understand the functional aspects of pools, TDEVs, FAST, and space saving technologies like dedupe, over provisioning, & compression further complicate the CM landscape.
Deploy SRM Suite data collectors to customers that subscribe to the service.  After interviewing customer about their environment, team would collect and report against a pre-set scope on desired systems on a periodic basis for trending.  A set schedule of joint meetings (customer, SE, SAM) to review the data.   3rd party arrays could be part of the offering if desired.   Emphasis would be on *capacity* reporting/trending, not system performance
