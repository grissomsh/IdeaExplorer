SYR Last Refresh Date Check
My idea is about creating a dashboard that automatically checks the SYR Last Refresh Date of the products that are not in Install Status in the IB.

Then these products to be sent to EMC account managers or engineers for them to check if the error is from the SYR or a wrong status assigned to the product
my main work is about the IB accuracy and the correct products configuration
This will ensure:

1- Having accurate IB data (If the issue is that the product is assigned to a wrong status on the IB)

2- Having accurate SYR Connection (If the issue is that the product is wrongly dialing home on the SYR Site)

3- Not missing any EMC revenues if the product correct status on the IB is to be installed

4- Enhancing the IB compliance
This will be a dashboard that could be extracted to check the EMC products that are dialing home on the SYR Site yet not in Install status on the IB

This idea will:

1- make money to EMC for the number of serial numbers that will be installed

2- Improve the IB quality and accuracy
