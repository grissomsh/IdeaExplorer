Provide access to additional lifts to exit, during peak drop / logout hours @ ICOE.

Lifts are too busy while peak hours, and have been a bottleneck in people reaching drop cabs during peak logout hours.
During peak hours, provide access to the additional lifts (for exit only). This will reduce cab misses and this save cost and time.
