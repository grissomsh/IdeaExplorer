3-Dimension Modelling System

We came up with the idea after seeing the initiative to provide virtual bio chemistry labs, neurological labs by Amrita University India. When we can do a complex biological experiments virtually we still have space to create virtual labs for all in IT industry.

A web application that will be built using rich UI to incorporate the 3D nature of the requirements. People from different geographies can establish a connect at a common virtual lab like application where they can make some modifications to the 3D model and diagrams. 
They can also store their results and theories for their future reference using the available Big Data technologies.
This will enable scientists to work in collaboration using emerging new and user-friendly software, Data-Scientist and trainers could design and develop interactive model resources by themselves.
This will create a Virtual world to offer real-time communication tools, interaction capabilities and collaboration empowerment tools to the users for group-work and team building, share events and presentations and constructive activities using Pivotal, VmWare, Greenplum and Big-Data/Hadoop.

OpenSim is one of the tools that can be referred.
