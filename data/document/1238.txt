Improve productivity by Leveraging Collaboration Tools While Simultaneously Converting EMC employees into SyncPlicity Ambassadors 
Improves processes at EMC by integrating EMC products, while simultaneously improving public adoption of SyncPlicity
If the space offered EMC users for free is competitive to draw them away from competitors, they will use the product and will become ambassadors for it – to friends and at work. This improves business processes at EMC, improves SyncPlicity adoption in the consumer space, and soon after would make a notable difference in the Enterprise space.
Grant EMC employees a significant amount of space (>100GB) that they can use even for personal use. (Of course, security restrictions would restrict the comingling of enterprise data with personal data.) This will allow employees to familiarize themselves and become attracted to the significant benefits of SyncPlicity in both their personal lives and at work. The former will lead to the latter. Simultaneously, being a campaign to encourage employees to take advantage of SyncPlicity at work. Literally every department could make tremendous strides in productivity if they integrated SyncPlicity into their business processes, it almost feels tedious to spell it out. Sales teams could trivially share presentations and data sheets internally. CoEs and facilities could share pictures, flyers, etc. in a collaborative fashion so such things don’t have to be uploaded to webforms but instead saved in intuitive shared spaces. Developers could share installation files and jar/war files. The list is too long to enumerate.
