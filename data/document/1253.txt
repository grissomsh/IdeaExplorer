EAS enhancement to avoid overlap and overlogging 
new idea to facilitate and improve time logging
because we face everyday the problem of overlogging and overlap on EAS 
implement a counter, in the service center an option like the initial response selection.

once the TSE start a webex or investigation with the customer the time sent is automatically calculated and that counter stopped only with the final log note, so if we submitted a log note in a different SR the initial counter will not be reset.

On the other hand we can dim the log time if the current total time is exceeding the actual time spent since the start of business hours.
we will have more accurate time logging and overall better reports
