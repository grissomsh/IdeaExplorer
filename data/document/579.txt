TLA Upgrade Program 
The idea was addressed as a Lean Six Sigma project in order to capture the value it brings in terms of time and cost savings.
The results are impacting many entities, and thereby affecting CSAT.

The idea came after realizing the issue is recurring in the Install Base and discussing its impacts with BTG team.
After brainstorming with BTG team and system developers, Work Request 396975 was raised to fix the root cause issue and Work Request 396974 was raised to perform a clean up activity on the current data 
Work Request 396975 raised for the fix and Work Request 396974 raised for the clean up activity were both implemented in Q2 2015
The TLA upgrade program currently nests Upgrade Parts to their TLA/s and replicate the TLAsâ€™ Owner party details in the Install Base. 
This increases the data accuracy, reduce workload and save man-hours as well as increase CSAT
