ODX for Exchange Database Same Server Seeding

After testing ODX to minimize the Jetstress testing cycle which typically takes upwards of 1-2 weeks, I was able to utilize our VNX2 ODX capabilities following the requirements and settings of Windows 2012 and drop the jetstress copy times down to 1 day.  Stressing this thought, I purposely created 3.6TB databases, 2 times larger than Microsoft recommends because of the amount of time to restore/seed, I was able to ODX copy 50TB in 23 hours proving EMC can not only offer much faster restoration of service of a single database in hours but an entire server in less than 1 day max 2 days and allow customers to utilize MUCH larger databases, which allows for larger mailboxes sizes for customers.
Utilizing ODX capabilities with Microsoft 2012 and Robocopy.  This solution would require at minimum 3 total copies, however 4 copies, 2 on 2 arrays would allow dramatically reduced times for RPO/RTO times including the full restoration of service of an entire Exchange server in 1 day, not 1 month.
