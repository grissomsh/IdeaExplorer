Pass it Along Teaching



I thought about it when considering the Community service challenge. Its’s something like pass it forward but with teachings.


You teach one student in a school and test him. This way you’d know if the knowledge taken is understood. Then give this student material to pass it on to the next. This way the student will become the teacher feeling responsible of teaching his classmate and with every classmate taught the knowledge is transferred.
