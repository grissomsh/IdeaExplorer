Working Support Sessions (WSS)
To embark on seamlessly integrating a workforce into Platform 3, workforce knowledge and experience is key. Building clear communication lines and a willingness to invest in the workforce is a fundamental must in pursuing P3 and also in showcasing EMC as potential employer of choice for new talent.
As a college co-op student, my experience with watching and learning is very fresh. However, like any learning environment, it is the action of implementing what you have learned that creates knowledge. This is facilitated perfectly through after college support sessions, "grinds" or labs on a one to one basis. I noticed when I entered EMC that while there is plenty of training there is very little follow up and support. In trying to upskill a workforce for P3 while also trying to attract the best from a competitive talent pool, such a service would provide the perfect facility to achieve both.  
"Experience is simply the name we give our mistakes" - an old saying indicating until we recognise our mistakes we have not gained in experience. The ability to admit mistakes or a desire to improve is one of the most sought after in an employee. A service to facilitate such workers and encourage self-development is my solution to these EMC challenges. A WSS would be an informal after work service (1-2 Hours) in which participants could work on their own job or project, while being facilitated by an experienced instructor/helper in that area. No PowerPoint or pre-planned notes would be used and participants are free to come and go. This will allow employees to work and learn in real time, while also gaining experience from other challenges facing employees. A WSS would be very applicable to IT skills such as; Microsoft Office, Coding Languages (Java,C++ etc.) or ERP Programs (SAP, Bobj etc.). The idea is to create a one to one learning scenario in which clear communication feeds both ways improving both user knowledge and experience, while also promoting EMC as an employer of choice.  
-Remediation in a company can be both time consuming and costly. Implementing WSS would target remediation directly as workers learn not only how to do something but why to do something. Understanding why is the key which will take this workforce and the next into the future and onto P3. 
-Quite often new hires or employees starting a new position may be under pressure with handling a new skill they are not yet comfortable. Rather than staying quiet, learning and application would be encouraged through WSS, improving processes and saving money.
-To build towards being a workplace of the future, EMC has recently targeted top spot of being Best Workplace. A WSS service would definitely help EMC to excel in this field and showcase itself as a top employer.
