Internal Social collaboration based appreciation system

Had this idea as part of an internal discussion with my friends
Option 1:
A simple quick integration with Lync (EMC unified communication platform)that enables an option upon clicking on an employee to press a LIKE button. These likes can optionally be converted into points in order to reward an employee. Please note that a simple database is needed to store these LIKES and points.

Option 2:
A standalone mobile app with simple PeopleSoft integration to retrieve the employees and their pictures and enable a quick search to find a named employee and give an option to LIKE.Please note that a simple database is needed to store these LIKES and points.
