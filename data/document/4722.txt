Electrical power saving Â©

I was searching on the net if it is possible to install a wind turbine designed to fit in central air condition parts where air flow is maximal for the purpose to generate energy. 
This link shows how free energy can be made out of a fan and magnets. Completely  independent from any power source.

In case you cannot access the link here is the explanation:

Installing small magnets on each extension tip of a fan (of the central air cooling systems in the office buildings) approaching another magnet to the fan would make it turn thus powering a lamp.

I imagine this small concept can be very beneficial if explored.
