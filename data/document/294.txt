Inside EMC Doodles
One aspect of diversity is to acknowledge the social and cultural events important for the diverse EMC family member.  This idea focusses on that aspect of diversity.
I got inspired with the painting of US White House with rainbow color in support of Gay Pride. I thought that if the US White House can acknowledge it and if google can acknowledge various events across the world using google doodle, then we should too. 
My idea is to start to acknowledge various diversity specific cultural and social events on inside.emc.com by displaying doodles regarding the event on the home page. This can be similar to google doodle http://www.google.com/doodles/ - wherein we change the logo or it can change in color and the banner section of the inside.emc.com home page.
I believe that this will increase employee engagement and awareness about the diverse employee base that we have at EMC.
