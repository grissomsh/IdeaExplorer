Using sensors for utilizing light consupmtion

The idea came to me while working in the office during a night shift and finding many meeting rooms lighted on unnecessarily.
Adding sensors in all floors corridors, printing rooms and training rooms so that the lights will be put on only when an employee/s passes by instead of being used unnecessarily at unneeded times.
