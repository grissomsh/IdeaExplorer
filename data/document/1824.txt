Graphics and Images database with Product Description
Reducing the potential risk of employee error. Alongside the product part number, it would provide a second source of confirmation; ensuring the correct product is on hand/ being shipped. Reduce any potential shipping errors, and help maintain high quality customer relations. Improving communications within EMC and with our business partners.
The idea was a product of a group innovation workshop incorporating employees across various teams within CS. The program was facilitated by co-ops. The idea was discussed and refined through group discussion.
Many products are known by their hardware designated name, i.e Megatron, BoneCrusher , Luna, Europa, Viking, Derringer, some parts are interchangeable between with exception of small changes which made compatible to a specific system, employees can currently only confirm they are working with the correct product based on Solve Desktop and part-number alone.
The solution would be to introduce a means by which all products part numbers can be checked against a graphic or image database, which the user can compare. This could be easily implemented in an upgrade to the current Parts Compatibility Database. 
The only comparison of a second source of confirmation currently available to employees is their own personal experience. Some employees are able to recognize a product by sight, but this is not a foolproof method. A more secure and reassuring method is needed.

By supplying a database that can give an image of a product, anyone can ensure they are selecting the correct part number which will fix the issue on the first call, without fear of error, reducing the logistic cost associated with partâ€™s dispatch, by consequence avoiding unnecessary field visits to a customer site related to a given Service Request.

This will benefit all staff member from the Global Customer Support department up to the Logistics Department.
