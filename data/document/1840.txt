Interdepartmental Exchange Program 
This will give EMC employees an insight and understanding of the roles and responsibilities of colleagues in different departments in the COE. It will help employees to collaborate on a greater scale, sharing skills and experience.
As a member of the co-op innovation team, I was tasked with encouraging others in EMC to submit ideas. All the while, I attempted to form an idea of my own. As a co-op, I am aware of my own lack of knowledge when it comes to other departments but was surprised to find a number of colleagues who share the same unfamiliarity. 
For any employees who choose to be part of the program, they will be assigned an exchange partner. Both parties will either observe or, where possible, receive hands on experience of their partner's role for one working day. The program would therefore last two working days to allow for each employee to spend a day in their partner's department. The days in question would be decided by the employees in question and approved by their managers.
It is a proven theory that introducing more people to a situation will lead to fresh ideas. Someone from another department might call to question areas of processes that could be improved upon, given their unseasoned exposure. Where a full time employee may excuse behaviours with "that's just how we do it", a member of this transfer program may ask "why is that how you do it?". This would lead to optimizing the efficiency of the process. This may lead to numerous benefits for the customer, the departments and the organisation.
