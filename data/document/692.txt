EMC Year Book
The main aim is to document and save all memories and all events happening in the whole COE. It will help in developing the diversity between the teams.

This idea cam back from the High School time in which we used to save all our old school memories and events each year among all the students and teachers and anyone in the school.
We will assign members from each team globally in order to be representing their teams and responsible fro gathering all their memories together. These members will collaborate with each other to create the book by th end of each year. This book will be distributed on the whole COE employees.
Satisfying the employees and showing them a sort of appreciation for their efforts and success through out the whole year. Also encouraging them to proceed and develop more when they feel that all their achievements are saved and recorded and can be seen by each single person in the COE. This will be a memory to be kept through years and once they see it and how they participated in creating it, it will draw a smile on their faces.
