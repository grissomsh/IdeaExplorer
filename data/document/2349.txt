Real time Partner/Customer feedback using Text/Sentiment Analytics from Social Media
EMC wants to extract meaning and tone from unstructured data (cloud based) and transform these insights into actionable text

This idea primarily focuses on –
•	Providing sentiment, sentiment scores, sentiment summary (Positive, Negative, Neutral) with Data visualization (graphical presentation), Themes breakdown, etc.
•	Important keywords (Sentiment bearing phrases)
•	Group it by problem type & associate it back to the original customer

After I got to know the TCE challenge, I started browsing to know which is the best tool to get to know the sentiment of our Partners/Customers. I found Semantria!!! 

Semantria LLC, founded in 2011, is a software-as-a- service and services company  specializing in cloud-based text and sentiment analysis. Semantria is a joint venture, co-founded by
the leading text analytics technology provider Lexalytics (Boston, MA), amongst other investors. URL - http://www.semantria.com 

The proposed solution is as below -

Gather the Partner/Customer posts on EMC/EMC related data in the social media –
External websites:
•	Twitter (tweets)
•	Facebook
•	Instagram
•	Linkedin
•	Technical blogs
•	Developer Community
Internal websites:
•	ECN (EMC Community Network)
•	Live chats
•	Online Support (https://emc.com )
•	Service Support Zone

Following steps to be considered -
1. Data Sources (Collecting data) – Using API/web crawlers source the EMC/EMC related data from external/internal websites
2. Data Consolidation - Streaming the data through RabbitMQ to ETL systems
3. Data Storage - Store the parsed data from ETL (GREENPLUM)
4. Data Consolidation - Use Semantria API’s, do analytics and predictions and store the predictions including time series information into GREENPLUM. 
5. Data Provisioning - should be done in order to have the users access securely
6. Data Discovery - Visualizing Data using industry standards (Tableu, R, Datawrapper, etc.)for dashboards
Example – Product level trendline, customer sentiment trendline, etc.

Once we have the data in Data discovery mode - we can have interactive reports and explore data to provide EMC with true insights with the ultimate solution which makes our Partners/Customer delighted and increase in trust/reputation of the company which inturn increases in the company's sales
1. Tangible advantage over competitors in identifying prospects with contextual data that can translate into improved sales performance.
2. Turn every piece of text into a profitable decision which in turn helps in productive growth
3. Text/Sentiment analytics can be done on 15 languages
4. Improvement based on Partner/Customer feedback, Automatic generation of new prospects

7. Real-Time Partner/Customer feedback can be seen
