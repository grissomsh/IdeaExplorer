"In-app ads" in XTremIO GUI
My idea is about use cases for the XtremIO array to offer new capabilities and efficencies to XTremIO end users.
I suggested this idea for VNX GUI - for "opposite" advertisements.  That is, if VNX is too slow for customer workload then produce advertisement  in VNX GUI to buy XtremIO AFA
Have simple analytics in XTremIO to judge overall AFA efficiency and to suggest additional purchase from EMC in XtremIO GUI, e.g. if the AFA is too fast produce "in-GUI advertisement" to buy VNX array from EMC.
One more marketing channel for EMC complementing products.
