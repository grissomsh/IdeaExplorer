How Big's Your Cloud? 

Reading the challenge description, I tried to come up with something I thought students could relate to and would also give them some perspective on the concepts of Storage and Cloud and how rapidly they personally are consuming storage via their music, pictures and video. The goal was an activity that was both educational and they could directly relate to. Also, it scales well for small or large populations of participants. This idea has not been implemented. 
The contest would involve working with the students to educate them on the high level concepts of Storage, Big Data and Cloud and then having them predict how much storage their class and/or grade consumes. They would also predict how much it will grow over a period of 1-3 months (contest period). There is also opportunity for additional math education by having them calculate the mean and median storage per student, standard deviation, variation by grade or gender etc. Comparisons between consumption rates for music vs. picture vs. video could also be of interest.  EMC would provide prizes for the best predictions and potentially free Cloud storage for the students. To reinforce the concepts of Big Data, they could extrapolate their data to predictions for larger populations and compare to industry estimates.
