Interactive product catalog  
It applies some technology regarding EMC products knowledge internally and externaly
We take alot of courses regarding courses and read about the products but those employees who don't deal with the product on sites or not technical engineers they can get things mixed up from time to time and this would be an easier and quick way to check any info needed.. Same for the customers. Idea initiated by Omar El Gazzar
Creating and app. for EMC different products with all their aspects and options and configuration. It could be for internal employees use with comments regarding its performance/ bugs/ development ideas with interactive images for the product to help understand more without having to be in-front of an actual one. It could be for external use for the customers to be aware of the products they have and others and be able to give them ratings and info regarding their maintenance and compare it to others feedback.
More understanding for the products by non technical employees, reachable knowledge, interaction regarding the product through rating and development ideas,sharing knowledge, saving time in reaching the info at critical times or for new engineers on site when needed.
