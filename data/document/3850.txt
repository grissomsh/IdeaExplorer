My Voice to improve EMC as great place to work

I got the idea while discussing during one of the My Voice action item meeting.
EMC to provide a input box for each My voice questions to employees, which helps resources to put the detailed description and reason for giving specific %. EMC can also provide a input box for each My voice questions which helps resources to put the detailed description on how and what EMC can do to make it to 100%. 

This will help HR and managers to get the feedback from the source. EMC to design a tool which will help to collate and identify top 10 suggestions for the managers, this will help HR and managers to take appropriate action to improve it.
