School Students innovate themselves!!

Came out with this idea as a method of encouraging students in schools to innovate and be indirectly involved in EMC community
The idea is about doing some workshops with the students, explain what is EMC technology, introduce the EMC products and help the students innovate new ideas for EMC, for the cloud technology or even for new products, by this, children will help contribute in EMC society and driving new ways to technology. Also using the limit free imagination of young people.
