STEM in a game

We got the idea during an ideation session thinking about new ways to make the students more linked to the STEM
* We aim to create a Facebook Application, more like a game where should contain several levels, the more levels they pass the harder the questions/ challenges or puzzles will become. Some advanced questions will require more research and collecting clues in order to solve certain puzzles; other challenges will include trivia questions, mathematical problems, word problems. 


* Each student will have his own account registered under his school name and they can compete with other schools the more they win a the more points they 

collect and the higher the rank they become. 


* Each student will choose the area he wants to compete in and collect points according to his performance against his competitor.

* Points will be distributed based on the weight of the questions, and the fields of the questions.

The results will be posted on their wall to encourage more engagement with other students. 

* Encouragement prizes will be given to the students that may include " a visit to EMC Labs".

* The winning school will provide computers to a selected school / university in need for computers/ or enhance their computer labs. The computers provided will be with EMC property logos.

The student with the highest score will get a VIP pass to EMC world and receive a gift on stage. 

One of the major benefits of this approach is to relate the students with the STEM materials and also to EMC a source for innovation and Technology.

EMC will be an icon for the students.
