Annual Google Map Hunt
Engages employees by making EMC a more enjoyable place to work
Idea came up under the topic of "Fun at the workplace" during a innovation session
I wish we could organize an online Google Map Hunt where the entire organization gets engaged in a competition where they have to solve and find clues using only google maps. Similar to a treasure hunt except using Google maps only. 

We could use the car from the quarterly car draw as a prize for the winner which would draw up more attention.


It would be an "Online Google Map Hunt" which would be open to the entire campus
