BRS/SAN Product should have capability to capture the SR details

Tracking Service Request getting raised for each product is always good for Service based industry. Person who manages the product on day-to-day basis doesn't know what are all the issues occurred for a particular product couple of years ago.
1) Design the Product to talk to the ESRS gateway server and then the Product itself need to have a separate option to raise SRs manually or automation for critical alerts
2) Product also needs to capture the SR details from EMC Support with SR reference, Plan of Action, etc...
3) If any issue has been raised for a particular BRS/SAN product - when the SR gets closure - Product needs to capture RCA of all the issues.
