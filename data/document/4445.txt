Tie up with Phone Operators for providing Cloud storage

Just thought of as an idea back of my mind and submitting for evaluation. I see EMC brand is missing in Indian IT industry. We are a global brand, we don't mean anything for India
Today everyone uses smartphone and storing data is critical. What if EMC is behind many of these customer in not only providing the required storage based on cost/usage model, but also provide complete backup & data retrieval & Security solutions. We can have a great penetration into to the Indian * China market.
