EMC Greenplum for HR decisions

I came up with this idea when i read the Greenplum slogan, "Data In. Decisions Out".
EMC has lots of HR data sources where each and every source is isolated (Not directly connected) from the other, like:
 
-Employee Quarterly Goals/Results
-Employee Development plan/progress (IDP)
-Employee Quarterly skill assessment
-Employee Performance History
-Employee Training History
-Innovation
ONE HR database using the EMC great product "Greenplum" where all HR related information can live.
This database will be directly connected to all HR data sources, ready to pull data and to give decisions to Managers.
Managers will have a direct access.
