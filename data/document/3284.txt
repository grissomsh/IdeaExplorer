Sponsor Cycle cost for employees who Cycle to Office

I initiated lead for a cycle stand and now the stand is full with cycles. To promote further cycling, more facility required for cyclers.
Employee comes to office in Cycle one way or two way. Provision in cabs to take-in/take-back the cycle.
Say if an employee commutes to office 200 days in a year  (one way or two way), 20 K (INR)reimbursed  (A good cycle cost)
