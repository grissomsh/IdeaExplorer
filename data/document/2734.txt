SoundCloud Meeting Rooms


We would like to think that our idea will help EMC create a modern and fun workplace.
This idea will change taking meeting notes at EMC, if will transform taking meeting minutes from a boring task to a fun collaboration.
It will also help EMC leverage its strong position in the market to create a new product that will open a new market for EMC.

We came up with the idea to make meeting rooms more user friendly and interactive on 15th May 2015.
Since then we have been adding features and thinking about what is the best markets for this new product.
We will start with offices and meeting rooms and continue on to include schools and universities.

Everyone knows sound cloud, imagine at the end of the meeting having the meeting recorded and posted on a web portal along with all the notes written in the time they were written at (much like soundcloud)
This product will be a new web portal for meetings that companies will use, it will integrate with MS outlook in terms of booking the meeting and the room.
Once the meeting starts the person who booked the meeting will log in to this portal as well as all the attendees.
The recording process will start, and each one will start typing their personal notes choosing to share them or make them private.
Once the meeting will end, a page will be created for this meeting much like a soundcloud song.
With all shared notes visible like comments at the time they were taken at.
This way we will not need any meeting minutes, nor we will need to memorize what is said or exchange notes.
Everything will be available online for the attendees to see.
We can also expand this idea to includes universities and schools to record lectures and students can share notes.


This product has the possibility to grow to include a lot of markets. We can even make it into an app on mobile phones.
It will allow us to penetrate new markets leveraging our strong position in the ones we are currently in.
