Big Data Store
A web-based worldwide marketplace for Big Data tools, algorithms, architectures, white papers and best practices â€“ call it the Big Data Store. A new EMC business and service.
Submitted similar idea for 2012 Innovation program. No formal work completed at this time.
This web presence is called Big Data Store. It is EMC branded throughout the store. 

A worldwide central marketplace for:
- Analytical tools and software packages for Big Data (these can be sold in the store and EMC can realize sales commission)
- Search algorithms and techniques posted
- Architecture designs, white papers and best practices can be posted. Suggest contracting with rock star Data Scientists to post monthly articles and white papers

Users can sign up for monthly newsletters, blog post articles, and other information.

All tools, algorithms, etc. can be reviewed by users and rated. With postings to social accounts like Facebook, Twitter, Google+, etc.

Other app features:
- Job board for Data Scientist to bid on job opportunities
- Job board for Data Scientist to post qualifications for consulting work, or link to LinkedIn for bio
- Big Data training and certification marketplace

As an alternative, much like VMware is set up to be independent and a standard across the industry, this Big Data Store may be better set up not as an EMC branded store but as a independent coalition of EMC Partners in the Big Data marketplace.
EMC (and Partners if set up this way) can realize revenue from tool sales and advertising, and added value by branding Big Data and EMC/Partners together. This is a new market opportunity for EMC.
