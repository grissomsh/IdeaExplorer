Real Scenario of SAAS Performance Test by User Behavior Replay
Our idea matches the Enterprise Content Division (ECD) Challenge because the proposed way is to improve SAAS applications performance to meet its rising requirement from internal and customers. The real scenario is the key to do performance test on SAAS applications, so the solution based on our idea will better insure the performance of SAAS for internal collaboration and customer TCE.
When we were discussing how did the performance test scenario close to real in production environment, the idea of recording, analyzing and summarizing the end users behavior came out. So we figured out the solution of to fix the challenge.
Current SaaS platform was built on CloudFoundry and every request to the platform will go to CF router first. We can build a proxy in front of or on the router to record the user request into log files. The user request only need to persist rest call and parameters. Once we got full records and sequences of the user requests, we could build another tool to replay the files to simulate real user behavior. The tool could be based on Apache Jmeter, an open source tool to perform load test with the same aim of LoadRunner. While replaying user behavior, we could also change the occurrence of the actions in log files to customize different load, stress or concurrency to estimate the situation when the number of user increased.
1. Record, analysis and summarize the real end users behavior. Supply materials for performance test and resources extending plan.

2. When we collaborating with internal products, we can settle different resource distributions for different products, based on different real users' behavior.
