Understanding EMC

brainstorming session
we will apply an exchange system internally in the coe, where we exchange employees in related department for a specific period so that they can understand the whole picture of the process.
Seeing the process on a diagram or a presentation is nothing compared of trying it personally and work on every aspect in it.
for example we apply an exchange between a member in SQC team and PM as there are many related documents and works is transferred between them ,, etc.
