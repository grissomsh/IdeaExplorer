Community Involvement Challenge
Since the challenge is to create platform independent mobile app, we are providing solution which will be easy to build using latest web technologies HTML5,CSS3 ,Javascript/Jquery , UI frameworks etc.
Currently I am working  on HTML5 mobile app development. This challenge resembles to what I am working on. My colleague Nihar and I decided to work on this . We first thought of SAPUI5 based app .so that it can be easily integrated to EMC Fiori launchpad.But because of UI limitation in SAPUI5 we switched to HTML5 based solution.

Rich user experience, platform independent , easy to develop, latest open source technologies which will be fast since we are concentrating on client side technologies .

•	Since it is the powerful UI framework we can build a great UI design using HTML5 CSS3 and UI framework
•	We are using more open source technologies and hence no licensing cost involved .
•	It has great re-usability and we can build on top of it very easily.
•	The user experience is responsive. So that if I run it in different resolution like iPhone,iPad ,android it will provide the different layout with rich User experience.
