Real Time remote power monitoring and power control using Intelligent Rack PDU 
The idea is an automated solution for taking control of the equipment power on/off procedure independent of the type of equipment racked up . This solution is vendor agnostic. Will help reduce the time power consumption and assist in monitoring of the usage trends 
One of my previous company was using this model as a go green initiative which helped us planning shutdowns and save lot of costs incurred due to powered on but unused equipment but those were earlier models of KVM and configurable PDUs

On following Intelligent rack PDU progress online I read about this solution which has more powerful remote control features and advanced monitoring and reporting
The Intelligent Rack PDU units when used along with the KVM provides greater control of remote systems both for on/off procedures and setup bring ups using remote installs . This solution eliminates the dependency on lab personnel to setup things like trivial installs and monitoring. 

Raritanâ€™s Power IQ energy management software consolidates power data from individual IT devices and racks and transforms it into useful information so you can

1.Make informed capacity planning decisions
2.Efficiently utilize power resources, while saving power and money
3.Measure PUE (Power Usage Effectiveness) and drive green data center initiatives

The thing that makes it unique is it has all the real time monitoring , secure sessions  reporting and remote iso installs generation as one solution while other solutions that I am aware of didn't have all these features as a single one stop solution 

Reduced lab support dependancy, Remote setup bringups , Planning capacity and outages better, Monitoring equipment being unused but consuming power , cut costs
