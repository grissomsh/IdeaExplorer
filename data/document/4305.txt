Wash your hands and save water

when I was washing my hands.
People usually wash heir hands after going to the bathroom so why not saving water while doing this  By connecting a sink to the toilet itself so after your done you wash your hands the running water that comes out of the faucet will flush your toilet at the same time so you used water once and did two actions at the same time..
