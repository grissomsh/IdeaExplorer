ViPR for fog computing
This idea provides a platform for executing distributed analytics in IoT using software defined storage
The idea is new for this contest.
ViPR is EMC Software Defined Storage.
It manages storage platforms and provides storage pools and centralized management for heterogeneous storage devices.
ViPR Services include Object, HDFS, and Block that can run on ViPR-managed file arrays and commodity platforms.
I propose we use ViPR to create the infrastructure for distributed analytics in fog computing, for example by providing every city/neighborhood with local HDFS for executing local map/reduce algorithms.
Smart "Thing" manufacturers interested in fog computing would come to EMC for analytics solutions. EMC federation can provide easy to manage distributed storage and provide analytics applications via Pivotal.

EMC can partner with Cisco (who coined the term Fog Computing) to provide the optimal infrastructure for fog computing.
