Enterprise Content Division (ECD) Challenge
1. Microsoft creates free Office apps on iOS and Android;
2. Some LBS applications using other companies' tech (like google maps and many other companies), the small companies help the product improved also provided useful data;
3. At present, more and more data are produced by mobile devices.
We can split our big applications to some lightly applications which implement some frequently used features and very friendly user experience.
In my solution, desktop applications should charge, but in the other hand, mobile apps should be free downloaded (also lightly app compare with desktop app) and towards plain customers. 
In the other hand, we can co-operate with other web companies, splitting our products suits into small applications, and using our techs (like scan & print) to their products.
These lightly products will help us to increase user engagement and build its reputation.
