Beyond MyVoice 

 
The idea came when I was discussing with my colleagues that satisfaction is better measured in real time more than in a yearly survey. We tried to reach aon in-between optimum solution utilizing both approaches.

 The idea works as follows: 
-	We will have an analytics engine that takes more than one input and returns a probability score for each employee/department as a satisfaction score and a probability to turnover or resign
-	The engine will take myVoice data for 3 years
-	The engine will take input data from other sources like :
o	Employee benefits 
o	Employees KPIs over time 
o	Employee activity score (*)
-	The engine will run Big Data Analytics against the huge amount of collected data to provide areas of focus and to propose corrective actions.
-	The proposed data analytics technique is “Time Series Analysis” that can study the data and behavior with time to see whether we are improving in different areas or not
-	The engine will output a “Satisfaction Score” and “Probability of Turnover” for the employee and enable management/HR to take corrective actions
(*) Employee Activity score is a proposed score in “Inside EMC” proposed in an Idea entitled “EMC-SAW - EMC Smart Active Workplace” submitted against Egypt COE challenge.
