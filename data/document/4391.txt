Single Avamar Hardware for TapeOut, Utility & NDMP

We have come across many situations where customer's are frustrated with the fact that they have to keep the Inventory of Multiple Hardware just for One Product. 
Currently we have different Hardware to work as Utility Node, Media Access Node and NDMP Accelerator Node. 
Why not include the functionality of Extended Retention & NDMP Accelerator to the Utility node itself. With this approach customer's have to purchase a Single Hardware for Operations like Tape Out and NDMP Backup
