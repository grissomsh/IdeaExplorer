Smart Meters for Smart Cities
Electricity issue in Egypt, where electricity is a main challenge. Power outage is something that need to be solved within any new smart city. 
Electricity issues all over the country.
The solution is to provide smart electric meters to the building, where the meter has 3 outputs of power covering the total power of the house. The idea of having 3 power outlets gives 3 levels of power supply. 
if the 3 outputs are on then full power is provided. If 2 only are provided then half power is provided. and if one output is only working this gives minimum power.

Using a central data analytics and collection of statistics from all meters, the platform can decide which houses will work on 1 output,2 outputs , 3 outputs.
This will provide a distribution of power and avoid complete data outage. 

Houses with low power utilization will not have power outage but houses using several ACs for example, will have half power disconnection so this will decrease the power utilization. 

Storage and analytics of all the metrics will be done through EMC platforms. 

 
make money, sell full solution, expand business and improve analytics.
