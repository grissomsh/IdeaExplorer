Social networking site internal to COE

Came across this idea when I was talking to my colleague about EMC innovation and ideas to great place to work. This kind of site was available in the previous organization that he worked and was a big hit!
So why another social networking site?
This site can be used for sharing\finding information which will help us doing our errands or which might require a dedicated search. For example one our colleagues wanted to vacate his flat and another colleague was search for one. If we have such sites, we can easily pass\share this information.
A website specially created for EMC employees which connects to everyone who is part of the site,. We can simply have an account to register and start communication. Just like any other social networking sites. We can share knowledge, photos, ideas, provide help like if you want to sell or buy something you can just post there and lot more activities can be carried out.
