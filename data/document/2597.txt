Diversity seating partitions
I would submit this idea to HR Challenge - Diversity and Innovation at a Great Place to Work for addressing different working style
Always thinking the people with different cultures would have different requirements of working environment
My idea is to divide all office to different function area with different collors, for example:
Blue - all seat in this area or through here will be quiet/silent, since this area is for who like quiet
Red - in this color area, people can discuss project, or problem freely
Green - in this area, people like office plants
and so on
If it is done in office, I think all persons will be confortable and creative with good mood
