Id Badge Scan station at Fire assembly point
The idea is to get all employees out of the Plant in a calm and safe manner to a designated Assembly point where they'd use their ID Badge to register that they vacated the building safely.
This idea came to me recently at a recent evacuation of the plant where we all left the building, but there wasn't any indication that all employees may have exited the building.
Once you've arrived safely at the Fire Assembly point, you would use your EMC ID badge and swipe it against a login station. This would then register that you vacated the building safely and are no longer at risk. A list of names that DIDN'T swipe their ID badge would then be compiled & made available to the Fire Marshall who then would relay this info to a supervisor, where he/she can update of their whereabouts.
The idea would consist of a number of login scan stations around the plant located at the nearest Fire exits and designated Assembly points.
It could potentially save lives and unnecessarily stop a Fire Marshall having to renter a danger zone.
