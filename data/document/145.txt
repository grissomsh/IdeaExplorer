EMC open source unified storage for OpenStack
This idea is to provide open source unified storage offering to OpenStack and other Cloud Platforms. As EMC has no such product currently, it will bring EMC enters a new market on platform 3. 
When I worked in the OpenStack product, I was impressed by the widely acceptance of Ceph and observed EMC has no similar product. While EMC is embracing open source and open source more and more products, I thought it'd be a good idea to combine our ViPR and ScaleIO. We could also be a big player in this market. 
ViPR controller already has the capability to privision object and file storage while ScaleIO can provide hyperscale level block service. With strong engineering team and existing products, it won't take much efforts to integrate these two together to provide unified block object and file storage to OpenStack. If we can open source it and get the community support, this will create a star product to shine in the market of Hybrid Cloud market like OpenStack and others.
If this product is developed and Open sourced. EMC will take huge chunk of market share in Hybrid Cloud storage market which will increase our influence to future Cloud standard creation. BTW, EMC could also provide implementaion and support service to this product which will generate revenues for EMC in the new area we haven't entered.
