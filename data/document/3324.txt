EMC Exibition

The idea came from my continuous concern in peoples' development in work and non work related perspectives
The idea is creating an event that is held once every quarter or every half year where EMC employees show their talents.
EMC is full of talented people; those who paint, sculpt, do other handmade stuff..etc.
EMC is to rent a place to serve the purpose. It is important to let talents shine. Employees with different skills can show their work and they may also sell their stuff to the public. By this they will gain money, EMC will invest in its employees and even EMC can take part of the commission for providing the place 'EMC Exibition'. and also we encourage people to further develop their talents.
