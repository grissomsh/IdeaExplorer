Automated System for better SRs handing using old SRs database

The idea came up from the daily work in which we notice huge amount of similar and identical SRs that has no option than separate  manual handling so far.
The idea is to collect the old closed SRs in a centralized warehouse where they are ready for analysis and query as follows :

1-	When a new SR is opened, the problem description is extracted and the engine starts scanning old SRs warehouse.
2-	The engine uses big data text analysis techniques over the old SRs to gets the best matched similar SRs.
3-	The results are ranked and returned to the TSE (SR owner) to check.
4-	The TSE makes benefit of the similar old SRs towards beter and faster resolution

The same recommender system can be used against the KB articles to add much more strength to the idea by making use of KB+old similar SRs recommendations
