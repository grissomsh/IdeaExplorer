Buisness Units' Portal
Many employees are not aware of other Buisness Units' roles and job description,
When an internal vacancy opens up, on which criteria do i decide if i want to apply
How to know whether or not other departments might be of help to our work, and if so, who should we contact
Many times i've been contacted by account managers wanting to fix a certain issue, but not knowing who to contact to have their problem solved
This portal should contain all EMC's Buisness Units

- Its Acronym ( ex: ASC: Account Service controller)
- Its Team members
- Its responsibilities and job description
- Hint about its acheivemnets

Each employee should have a background on EMC's business units, i think this will help us to be a better place to work ,satisfying any employee needs related to this as well as enhancing the communication and connection between EMC teams
