Up-skill me for existing applications 
There seems to be a lot of existing applications available at the moment that are constanly evolving within EMC. As one group may manipulate a particular tool or application, the output may be beneficial to many other groups within a department or to a wider audience. By sharing these outputs, existing processes may be improved and developed to the next level, keeping all of the wokforce up to date with the latest developments available as the industry evolves.
Was the output of an Idea Generation Session that we hosted for our own group here in ICO (International Customer Operations)
We have been told the benefits that that can be achieved by using programs such as BOBJ as opposed to excel etc. but there has been little or no training offered. Also there are updates to existing applications such as ACE, or a different way to use SAP to remediate issues with orders/dropships where the knowledge is shared with a very small audience. Better and more structured training that is relevant to the "learner" would be greatly beneficial to the group as we try to be more efficient in our roles.
If a more structured training programme were available within departments as applications develop and evolve, the fear of transferring from existing processes would be removed and people would have greater confidence and knowledge to be able to attempt to improve the way we currently do buisness and become more efficient.
