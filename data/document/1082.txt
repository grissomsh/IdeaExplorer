Intelligent Resolution Provider System (IRPS)
The IRPS system must be to provide the customers with immediate resolution if they encounter any problems/issues while using any of the GSE products. The System must be a store of all relevant data that has been collected before and also should have a mechanism to retrieve new data that gets logged for a product.
We used to interact with customers and provide resolution to the customer for the issues they face while using our products. The time the issue reaches to us takes more than a day or 2, by that time the customer must have already escalated it or found some improper alternative.

The IRPS should be able to help them get through the problems quickly which will make the GSE product usage seamless.
The IRPS has primarily 4 components

1. Analytical Engine
The primary responsibility of this engine is to process customer data and provide the most appropriate solution to the customer.

2. NoSql Database
The NoSql Store can have preloaded data which is available for a product and the data that is obtained after processing the customer problem by the Analytical Engine. MongoDB/DocumentDB can be an example.

3. Client Plugin
The plugin will be integrated with the GSE products and must be able to collect data and send to the IRPS MQ

4. Message Queue Service
The MQ Service will act as a message broker and send all the collected data to the Analytical Engine on demand/schedule. ServiceBus/RabbitMQ can be an example.
Better Selling and Customer Satisfaction of our products.
