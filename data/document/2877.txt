Compliance button for customers in each SR to be able to rate them internally between CS and field
the customer can rate and give his feedback on the TSE/Engineer working with him which is critical for the levels of service presented , adding a compliance button for the customer can also add so much to the process efficiency which enables the customer 
I am a TSE in NetWorker team , and I came across a service request where there was a compliance button for rating the partner's performance on the SR. I believe it was the best cooperation I got during my 5-months experience , I always got prompt update from the partner , he was technically very capable and thorough on the case updates which led to a more efficient performance and faster resolution to the case

My solution is that as the customer have the capability to rate the engineer's performance through performance rating surveys or other performance portals , the engineer can also acquire that privilege to rate the customer internally with the sales/accounting team through a compliance button which could have sub-tabs to indicate the customer is well trained/technically capable or not , whether cooperative and focused on the issue or not and indicate his sense of urgency regarding the case updates. this approach is time efficient , the engineer can easily tick yes/no answers on the compliance sub-tabs questions on case closure , if one customer is receiving non-compliance reports from several the engineers , the accounting team could contact to make him aware of those certain points to work on them

the engineer can easily tick yes/no answers on the compliance sub-tabs questions on case closure to rate the customer's performance , this would enhance the productivity and focus on the issue also would save a lot of time for the engineer if the customer
