New SR Status To Be Added On Sales Force 
Innovation for Sales Force! 
This came through a discussion we had in one of the meetings regarding Sales force. 
It address a need. 
Create a new Service request status in sales force called 'Updated by customer' which will flag the SR automatically when it has been updated by the customer. 
We will be able to tell when a customer has updated the SR without going inside. 
Will make our work easier and faster. 
Will respond quickly. 
Will be able to know how many SRs need to be worked o once you come in before taking new SRs. 
This will serve the licensing team and all the technical teams best.
