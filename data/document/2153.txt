Remote control and monitoring
The challenge is asking for an idea that will assist the administrators to identify and monitor possible issue and provide customized user interface and make use of data analytic solutions.
The idea is an output of graduation project that belongs to Electronics engineering Major in the American university in Cairo. The modules are easy to buy and program 
Using Zigbee modules, issues can be monitored using wirelss sensor network that can send the output to a web service ( interface) or a message to the administrators using networking techniques.
It will look like a group of sensors that are located in different geographical places with a monitoring interface for data analytic.
