Add-ons in Everyone Sales Portal

Customers have reached support several times stating they have not heard from Sales team and request for the tracking id or oncall number.
Whenever there is a request submitted on behalf of a customer on Everyone Sales Portal, there should be an unique tracking id generated along with the on-call number where the customer can reach the Sales team directly.
There should an option to provide the customer's email address so that the customer is intimated with an auto-generated email along with the unique tracking id when we submit a request on behalf of the them so that they get to know that there has been a request raised for them and this will also build a trust relationship with our customers and customer need not come back to support to confirm if the request has been processed or not they can follow the Sales team.
