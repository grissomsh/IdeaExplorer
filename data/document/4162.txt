Reimbursement for Employees opting own transport

I live 13 kms away from Office and for the past two years I am using own transport
which takes about 40 mins(to and fro) every day on traveling which includes peak hours.

Earlier When I used transport for 3 years:
I have to spent about 120 minutes on traveling for just 13kms distance. This is because I had to abide to the rules of Transport routes, where more than 60 minutes was used to pick up and drop my peers living in a different direction.

To summaries; I am happy that I save 60 or more minutes a day where I can spend time with my family.

Happy family leads to Happy Employee and Happy Employee leads to happy performance.
It is not necessary everybody should use personal motor transport. 
Many people prefer using bicycles or even public transport.
Company can save about 20% of cost if just half is spent on 40% of its employees instead of Transport.
