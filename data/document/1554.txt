SecurId software Token for Apple Homekit & Google Brillo 
Secure access of/for IoT devices.
While working with RSA Authentication Manager ct-kip service recently, this idea came up.
The access to & from the IoT devices with SecureId software token installed will be authenticated using deviceID & random SecurID Token generated. This solution is targeted for IoT devices running on Apple Homekit or Google Brillo platform.

Token will be seeded/configured on the thing/device using CT-KIP protocol over Https or CoAP. 

End user will be accessing the thing/device from  mobile/desktop via SecurID Authentication Manager. Authentication Manager in turn communicate with the device using the token & device id configured for that IoT device.

The device which receives the access request compares its device-id & generated token code with the incoming request and grants/denies access to device based on authentication outcome.

For sensor like devices, it will authenticate using the these dynamic credential prior to sending data.


Increased revenue from RSA SecurID software tokens.
Enhanced security for IoT devices.
