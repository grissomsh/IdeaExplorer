Periodic health check for all EMC products

customers' satisfaction is an important EMC value this could help in increasing it
with any customer buying a new EMC product or upgrading their product they will get a catalogue of how the periodic health check works 
that health check will be based on each product's type
for example: customer will get a product that is annually health checked so every year the support will remotely check it and inform the customer if any flaws found
after that they will inform the IBG team inorder to reflect that on IB so as to have a record for this issue on our database for future record
