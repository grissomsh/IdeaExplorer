My idea can increase the customer satisfaction
Ideation Session
Create a mobile application that receives a message from the server if anything goes down, and then customer immediately goes to the application and chat with one of our customer service representatives to define their problem.

If the problem needs a call our representative will give them a call.

At the end of the chat conversation a feedback will be conducted by our representative to the customer.
If the idea succeeds this will increase the customer satisfaction
