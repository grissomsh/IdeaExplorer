Interactive Application Security Training
This idea will increase the security posture of our products which will ultimately improve the quality of our products on release.
Brainstorming session within PSRC
Design an interactive hands-on training platform which walks engineering teams involved in software development to complete a series of modules on software security and secure coding. The training will be comprised of individual tutorials, and the topics  will highlight common software security issues derived from sources such as OWASP Top 10 and SANS CWE/SANS Top 25 Most Dangerous Software Errors. Each tutorial will not only describe the security issue and provide remediation guidance, but will also provide snippets of insecure code to allow the training participant to fix them. The training participant will submit the fixed code to the training platform and will be given instant feedback. At the end of the training, the training participant will be given an insecure application and asked to fix it, leveraging the concepts learned in the training process.
This idea will help increase security knowledge of product teams, and empower them to squash security bugs earlier in the software development lifecycle.
