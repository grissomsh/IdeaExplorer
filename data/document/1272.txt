Egypt COE Skills Matrix project
In the efforts of connecting employees across different functions and geographical locations at EMC there should be a single portal that has enhanced search criteria along with full employee details to reach out for the diverse talents at EMC

In Egypt COE Skills Reporting Process, currently the time to search for a specific skill is 11 mins on average, and the percentage of Egypt COE employees with recorded skills is zero%.

Currently, we don't have a tool to deliver complete & updated information about all EMC employees, prompting users to searchÂ different portals to find the right information. This creates a disconnect in communication amongst different functions & geographical locations   

Developing a tool to enable the employees in Egypt COE to record their skills.

Decrease the time to search for a specific skill from 11 mins to 2.75 mins on average and raise the percentage of employees with recorded skills from zero% to XX% in Egypt COE Skills Reporting Process by 1st of November, 2014.
