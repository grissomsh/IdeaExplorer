Online compatibility matrix
The compatibility information is now avilable to the customers in tabular format, which is cumbersome and confusing to use. 
Internally, it is very difficut for the writers to comprehend all the possible compatible combinations during every release and add in the document. 
From past experience.
The proposed solution is to create a dynamic html page and add the required source and destination version(s) of the xCP product as required by the user. An online compatibility matrix is generated. 
This is very comprehensive and easy to maintain as well.
Comprehensive solution, easy to maintain regardless of the number of releases, uploading of source files to the server is a one-time activity.
This largely improves customer satisfaction and also optimizes the involved process and thereby benefits the organization.
