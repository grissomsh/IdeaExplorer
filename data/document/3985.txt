Power Saving

It came to me when i was thinking that the Battery was always charging and consuming a lot of energy for no logical reason while for example locking the laptop at the office till the next day and such
While Laptop is docked at the office it only starts to charge when it hits 50% and when it reaches 100% it stops charging until it reaches 50% again.
