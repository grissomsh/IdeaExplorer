Egypt COE SOP Library
The idea covers the improvement of all inefficiencies in processes in Egypt COE operations
The idea came from the discussions done under the TCE Program at Egypt COE with our main sponsor Magued Mahmoud (Egypt General Manager) and we talked about the importance of filling the gaps in all process documentation and improvements for all operations under Egypt COE
All Egypt COE Business Units should have their processes reviewed and documented in SOPs so that they can be shared in a SOPs Library (web application)
The big aim is to certify ISO 9001 under this initiative
