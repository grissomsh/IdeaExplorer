Runtime Operator define and Sorting at runtime in xCP
ECD challenges
As xCP developer, this idea came when I use other products of Documentum. 

It would make customer more convenient experience.  
1. solution would be a configure page for query or changeable operator at runtime.

2. sortable API at client in result list. It would enable when all results are returned to client. 
Improve customer satisfaction.
