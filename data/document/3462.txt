Shower Rooms

It's avaible at the airport and when I used it I thought of why not having one at work.
A couple of shower rooms will be available where each of them has a secure entrance card. Whenever one wants to take a shower he takes that card and then returns it when his done. Then it should be cleaned by the staff after each use.
