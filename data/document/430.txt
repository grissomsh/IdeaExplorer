Real time monitoring of atmospheric contaminates to allow ambient to cool Data Centers 
Reduce reliance of power hungry mechanical and electrical systems to condition the air by allowing ambient air into the data center instead. 
Working in the pharmaceutical sector, spectroscopic analyzers were ubiquitous in the monitoring of emissions from the plant and used as process analytical technique for quality control of product.
Some data centers use Copper/Silver Corrosion Coupons and Quartz Crystal Microbalance (QCM) to monitor the Corrosivity Rate within a data center. Feedback from these instruments results in a delay for the data center control system to react to high levels of contaminates. Using spectroscopic analyzers and chemo-metrics, real time monitoring can be achieved to allow the control system to react and prevent corrosion damage to electronic equipment. These analyzers can also be used as inspection tools for failed PCBâ€™s on site rather than been sent to the vendor.   
The analyzer itself will be kept in a cabinet where optical fibers can be routed to various locations within the data center to sampling cells. Once enough data has been analyzed, portions of the data center would then be gradually cooled over time using ambient air until the whole data center is directly by ambient air.
