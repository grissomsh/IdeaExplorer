Mechanical Drive breakdown EOQ by Celestica Galway
Up skilling of internal people in EMC to complete this task.Enhances EMC abilty to build exactly waht the customer wnats without having to purchase and build more drives from the vendors.
Only doing drive mech conversions for about 4-5 quarters now so this was idea floated during one of the prep meetings for this quarters rework.
Give Emc more fexability in not alone doing Drive mech breakdowns at end of quarter but anytime throughout the quarter as EMC would have personnel onsite all the time.
Success would be that no personnel from Celestica Galway would be needed inhouse to covert a drive mechaically, i.e. change paddle card and carriers.
