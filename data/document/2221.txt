Dormitory for GCC Team
N/A
Many a times, an employee who is not well and needs rest has to go to 6th Floor dormitory. However a dormitory within the same floor for GCC team is a feasible idea to ensure easy access and mitigate any issues, where in easy accessibility of the employee is needed for work purpose, if alone in the shift.
Since GCC is a 24x7 team, situated at 1st floor of Tower A, a Dormitory within the same floor is a feasible idea.
Better coordination and helpful for sick employees
