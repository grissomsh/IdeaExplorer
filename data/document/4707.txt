New Marketing Methodology for 2nd + 3rd Platform

I came up with this idea after find good solutions and products saturated and canâ€™t expand in the market, just because the awareness plus the real hands-on experience will make the customer more confident about the products capabilities and the rules always changed. So the question was how to simulate the large boxes to portable simulator even to show end-to-end setup?
Sometimes to buy solution or product the decisions indirectly coming from Down-Top and the Customers today having their own IT Professionals/Experts and they always oriented around what they learned or experienced before our target to reach them by small EMC Program for the external IT Professionals (Technical Staff) to learn the new technologies also we listen to the challenges they have, The idea can be delivered using below:
These options can be classified to several groups such as industries IT divisions, education   

1- They can use a mobile app to learn about new technologies or features for specific products
2- Try Simulation tools for new products or features (Learn by example Techniques)
3- Show specific products enhancement or how-to (Tricks)  
4- Provide products simulators to the universities labs for students to learn about the new technologies specially the computer departments
Once they confident about any product this can spread everywhere a positive feedbacks Down-Top
