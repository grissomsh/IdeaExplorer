EMC Training Center

Being interested in courses and because of the limited seats, employees are put in the waiting list which is causing frustration.
Having a Training center for EMC realated courses. We quarterly recieve courses like soft skills and technical ones where we don't find enough seats and have to be among the waiting list. This is very frustrating as we don't have enough training rooms in the premesis to suffice the count interested in courses. So why not EMC rents a training center with big training rooms. This will allow a big number of employees to participate in the courses they want without having to wait for more 3 months till they recieve other offerings.

Moreover, the training center can also serve another purpose. Employees are sometimes asked to go to specefic centers to certify in certain courses like ISM. If we have a nearby center for EMC, it will facilitae their experience in having the test and getting the certification.
