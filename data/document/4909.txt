To manage muliple test areas activities on same array

This is raised during an engineering meeting when we want to do cocurrent testing on same array
My understanding of the main challenge is how to handle the conflict of soft objects usage. I image the 12 testing as  muti-tenants customers, so for every object it should belong to a tenant, if we properly keep the object-tenant mapping info in testing, then the 12 test areas can work on the same array. 
For muti-tenants customers, every object it should belong to a tenant, if we properly keep the object-tenant mapping info in testing, then the 12 test areas can work on the same array. 
So we can have test framework to do object mapping process as:
1.	Before each object create operation command, test framework query the Object ID in mapping table to check conflict.
2.	If there is no result, which means no conflict, the Physical ID and Physical Name can be same as Object ID, Object Name
3.	If there is query result, which means there is already existing object. Test framework assign Physical ID and Name by defined incremental rule and insert into the table.
4.	Before each fetch/update/delete commands, test framework query the Object ID in mapping table to get the Physical ID and Name and translate commands with Physical ID and Name.
