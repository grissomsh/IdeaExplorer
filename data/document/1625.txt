Tweets like emails
making the communication in the workspace more fun.
.
the idea is to make a tweeter like internal website and make it accessible through emails so that the employees can simply send emails as a tweets and all the other employees who subscribe to the service receive that tweet so that they can share more and have more fun.
adding more fun to the work place communication.
