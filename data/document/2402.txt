Job Swap/Knowledge Sharing sessions 
Improve communication across our multiple EMC and Federation sites and Upskill our existing talent by introducing Job Swap/Knowledge Sharing sessions at non-peak times of the quarter. E.g. Order Mgt with GRO/Sales, this is a great way of developing talent
We had an Idea Generating Sessions within ICO and this idea came about when we were discussing how we could improve communication across our multiple EMC and Federation sites and also Upskill our existing talent .  We felt there is huge opportunity to gain valuable knowledge and improve communication flow from this job swap idea.
Direct job swaps with relevant departments that we work with day to day .From practical experience in other groups we are growing and developing our own talent and using these new skills to resolve issues more efficiently.  By gaining more knowlegdge on how other groups work we are also improving our communication flow.
The success and benefits of this for ICO would be a much improved communication flow across EMC while also upskilling our current talent.
