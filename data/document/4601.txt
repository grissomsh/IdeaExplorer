FlexQube

Franklin Process Engineering explored current material handling products with flexible/configurable features utilizing standard components.  While researching on YouTube, a video of the FlexQube system was discovered. The video provided a clear product concept and its potential use for addressing the problem noted above.  After further research, the supplier was contacted to perform a hands-on product demonstration.  Currently, we have a design being applied as a proof of concept for a manufacturing application. 
FlexQube is a modular based system built from common standardized components.  Since the components are standardized they can be reused/repurposed into new units as designs change. This material can easily be transformed to serve any purpose.
