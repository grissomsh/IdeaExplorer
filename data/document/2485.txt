EMC Product Performance Measures
Create a system that proactively rate(s) EMC products internally to provide a simple proactive level of feedback to our corporate level executives, engineers.   The goal is to develop product consistency across related product lines and identify potential
This is based on years of observation at EMC. 
Using existing EMC resources (a committee) to come up with the measurements and standards by which our products are rated. Consider using random blind surveys from those who internally service and maintain our products.  Basic evaluation parameters would need to be devised (ie: Connective ability, auto reporting, Install base size, DU/DL Rates, Failure Rates, and finally blind internal surveys on process) to internally measure a products ability to be installed, serviced, reported on and maintained.  As part of the rating process EMC has an opportunity to self-evaluate and ask internally “How did we do?” to a wealth of experts who are the best at what they do and are vested in providing feedback.  Of course by blind surveying a random sample of employees performing services and activities EMC can develop a better sense of how to improve our products and processes.  I believe that through a program of product certification and conformity EMC would be able to pro-actively understand how our products are viewed.  By using employees to fill out surveys we could get faster feedback on problems areas that may exist against our a predefined set of standards.
I would call it a success if our executives and engineers were to use the feedback as a goal to improve our products according defined EMC standards.
