Tester Auto-configure Tool
1. make GPO/EMC’s supply chain and manufacturing operations more efficient and effective
2. advance the performance of our designs, and supporting processes
3. transform across the end to end supply chain in terms of cost, quality, availability and time t
In Q3 of 2014, GHTS needs to deliver more than 30 SLIC testware packages leveraging 4 testers, each release costs 2 weeks'qual. That means a strong need of Auto-Config tool. GAME also runs into similar situation.
Tester environment issue trouble shooting costs a lot of time. 
GHTS QA team identified these improvement opportunities. 
1.	The tester auto-config tool will automatically configure tester to support testing multiple products of same type (like SLICs) at a time within a couple of simple button clicks. 
It will enable each product to automatically discover desired UUTs and load desired diag and testware to test. Products run without interference.
2.	It can check test environment health status and report tester environment issues.

For #1, existing approach is a set of manual steps for SLIC config in lab in small scale. It’s inefficient, error prone. No existing approach for #2.

1. It can improve improve tester productivity by 2-8 times in testing a product depending on UUT amount in a the tester. It can greatly enhance tester productivity.
2. Enlarge tester capability means same amount of testers can test more products within sa
