Coderdojo for Adults
This would meet the challenge of up-skilling existing EMC talent by developing new skills or nuturing currently under utilized skills in a creative, fun and social environment.
 I was part of an idea generating session within our own group within ICO. One of the focus areas was around upskilling existing talent and the success of Coderdojo prompted the idea of a similar style of club aimed at the mature audience.
By implementing a Coderdojo style initiative for existing EMC talent, this would encourage current employees to pursue a new & exciting challenge within this rapidly expanding employment market. A similar format to the current Coderdojo for children that is being used in today's world could be applied to these adult focussed sessions.
Success of this for me would be the opportunity for existing talent to upskill as well as the networking/teamwork opportunities.
