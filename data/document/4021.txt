The fous and outcome of the effort in Big Data and analytics area should be BUSINESS, not Product selling. 

The feedbacks partners and at times customers have provided is, EMC as federated companies have one of the best and complete technology platform/stack, but we are not leveraging our full strength which is why we are able to establish instant connects with IT but unfortunately not the same with Buisness. Big Data and analytics is all about making a difference to BUSINESS with IT as enablers. 

Remember: The outcome of the effort in Big Data and analytics area should be BUSINESS, not Product selling. 
The data architecture world is undergone a permanent change in last few years and has matured to the 3rd generation platform. Interestingly, big data does not qualify only on Data fabric; it also has great impact and contribution from Cloud fabric and more importantly App Fabric. 

Today, in the market, EMC federation company is THE only platform which can bring holistic perspective of Big data and analytics of enterprise class. As a practitioner, I personally believe every employee within the federation should be up-skilled/cross-skilled to all the three fabric layers, particularly the application layer. It’s not an easy change to bring as it’s a cultural change and can happen only if people's mind set and perspective changes towards the way industry is progressing. However, it’s not impossible as well, particularly when we are so equipped and prepared to address the industry needs.  

What’s needed today is awareness, knowledge sharing, boot camps, workshops and most importantly spending more time with partners and customers to understand their need of the hour. We should create more solutions which will help us connect with Business instantly.
