We(Minh, Shobhan and Swati) came across Community Involvement Challenge on the innovation central. We came up with an idea of a system that can be accessed via web or mobile to provide a crowd-sourced innovation management portal to encourage community to actively contribute.
By building an internal crowd-sourcing platform that can be accessed through web and mobile devices, the organization not only benefits from constant stream of ideas from employees, but also has the opportunity to extend its culture within the company. The life cycle of an idea is improved as it is constantly tracked and given feedback from employees whose expertise span across multiple functions. The platform creates a win-win situation for both employers and employees.
It will be a mobile application and/or a web application that allows internal and external users to contribute to the innovation and enrich the ideas.
Our definition of success for the system is to transform the culture of our company in such a way that innovation becomes a habit for the employees and they continuously strive to  create and implement new ideas.
Company can benefit immensely by not only firming its foot in current market, but also continuing to expand to newer markets. This means more revenue, employee satisfaction and also happy customers.
