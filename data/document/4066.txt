Advertise for previous innovation ideas

I was going through the ideas from past years that didnt win and found alot of them very usefull.
Review ideas that were submitted in previous innovation events and pick some of the ideas that did not get much exposure and expose them (maybe posting them on a bulletin board or in elevators). While those ideas might not be necessarily perfect (hence the lack of exposure) they can inspire/influence people to use their concept and improve upon it in generating more ideas.
