ScaleIO as a Service for Hybrid Cloud
Leverage ScaleIO for multi-site storage backup in hybrid cloud.
We have done a POC of containerizing ScaleIO. This make deploying ScaleIO more easily cross platforms. We have also created app templates for Murano and committed it to the OpenStack community. We think it's a good idea to provide ScaleIO in Murano as well.
ScaleIO is a pure software storage production so it can be installed in either physical machines or virtual machines. Servers located in different sites can be combined into a storage pool. ScaleIO will copy all data and the fault set feature allows users to avoid store the origin data and backup data both in the same cloud.
Our proposal is to provide ScaleIO as a Service. For example, OpenStack has a catalog  project named Murano. Users can create instance with ScaleIO easily by Murano functions. The major thing we need to do is create a public template for ScaleIO. We can also integrate it in VMware cloud.
Leverage ScaleIO in hybrid cloud and create new offerings.
