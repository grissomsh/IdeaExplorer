Customer and Support Engineer participating on New product test during Alpha/Beta and Release phase and sharing feedback to New Product development team
Lots of issues found during how to use new products functionality, Pre Release Documentation does not cover all steps and Engineer/tester are struggling for validating basic functionality and not even reach to level to test new advance  feature/functionality  

EMC Product development/QA team needs to share at least basic product usability details 

At present Engineering training session in Alpha/BETA phase only covers new feature/functionality and not having information how to use/test the same
