EMC World Music Festival
Working across multiple EMC Federation sites and geographies and at all COE sites to bring together the Artistic and Technological community for the first of an annual EMC World Music festival.

The idea was prompted from viewing the EMC World conference in Las Vegas in 2015. Watching the One Republic set inspired the idea to make the EMC World into a more Global experience.

EMC World is an annual summit to showcase EMC technologies and business strategy. In 2015, the conference featured bands like Fall out boy and One Republic and in 2014 Imagine Dragons played to close out the event.
In 2016, an extension of EMC World is the EMC World Music Festival. Unique in the industry, EMC would be the first Multi-national company to host 24 hours of staged Music events across all COE sites with featured "live" transmissions of major artists to all sites. Local Artists would also support the event to cater to different geographical and cultural tastes in Music.

The EMC World music festival is a very powerful way to brand EMC in the 21st Century. The Global market place is challenging, Global recognition is even more challenging. Music breaks boundaries both socially, culturally and geographically. Staging a Global Music festival for a Global audience sends a very distinct message about what type of Company EMC wants to be in the future. The Branding opportunities are endless and even more significant if EMC get there first!!
