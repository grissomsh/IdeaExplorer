Business Alliance With all
My Idea is to create common platform for all the businesses within EMC and also with EMC federation Partners.

With in EMC Bangalore , i see many teams starting to collaboratively work together, this model we can apply for global services as well.
My Solution is to create common platform, i.e to bring the activities/work together which are done remotely within the EMC and EMC federation companies .

For Example: There will be more similarity in some Product development or services rendered, this activities can be brought together and create a common command center , so that we can up-skill the employees and can Provide a better resolution to the customers.
Benefits are as below:
-Better service to the customer as we bringing more people together.
-Up-skill the Employees.
-Cost Perspective, we can have better teams in-house , rather than outsourcing some of our activities.
-Better Success to the company.
