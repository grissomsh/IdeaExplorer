Collaboration
Providing a collaboration space would span across all of EOS2 functional groups as well as other cross-functional and Federation teams.  The goal would be to utilize EHC to provide and internal and external collaboration tool.
EOS2 PLM Operations team held a brainstorming session on utilizing the EHC to improve services.  This idea is new and being developed for the CTO challenge.
Today, there are many tools utilized to share information from Inside EMC to Syncplicity, SharePoint, eRoom and even email.  Search capabilities across all of those platforms, mobile accessibility, and social capabilities such as crowd sourcing are difficult or impossible.  Many groups have been trying to develop solutions on one platform, but utilizing EHC with scalability capabilities, 3rd platform development environment, and a solutions oriented environment, would provide the infrastructure to link and search disparate systems as well as store all forms of files, source codes, test cases, solutions, etc.  This could be implemented with ServiceNow KB, as well as provide external access for federated companies using the hybrid cloud approach.
Increasing self service by consolidation of support documents, KB articles, shared presentations, projects plans, etc. would provide transparency across EMC II and the Federation companies to share and collaborate and @scale solutions.
