3D User manuals

Having been involved in a project that uses 3D models for visualising hardware,  we came up with the idea of using similar approach in user manuals.
Each EMC product will have an online manual page that would display an interactive 3D model. Depending on the task that person has to perform: changing drive, replacing battery, removing chassis etc. 3D model would be used to display animation showing all necessary steps needed to safely perform that task.
