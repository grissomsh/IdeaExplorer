To provide whole sets of electronic components for mechanical suppliers for assembly trials in first time
Mechanical suppliers will be more capable on finding and preventing issues during fabrication of components or trial assemblies. It will make GPO/EMCâ€™s supply chain and manufacturing operations more efficient and effective. From time to time we were surprised by suppliers after checking assemblies onsite, for there was no basically pre-check handled by supplier before arrivals of EMC staff.
We found HDDs got stuck at some drive slots last year. Supplier had to adjust the stamping die to improve the drive slot shape.
By providing a whole set of electronic components/assemblies to mechanical supplier in first time, they would be able to try the functional fits easily and to improve some simple/elementary findings raised by themselves.
Normally EMC staff bring the electronic components to mechanical supplier sites for EVT, DVT trial runs and checks. This would be a bit late and not that make sense or time saving. Try to send the electronic components to mechanical supplier and ask them have a trial assembly before arrival of EMC staff. 50% of issues (simple issues) could be identified in advance and let the remaining 50% of issues to be found and solved by working together from both sides.
