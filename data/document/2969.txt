VMAX Applications Store
This brand new mobile-like market will cover all VMAX3 customers and vendors interested in development for Enterprise using Hypermax providing them with easy and clear E2E communication while still being easy to develop.
This idea has just got to my mind in past 3 hours and I thought that it could help with Hypermax OS and VMAX marketing.
Create VMAX Store, where customers can browse (through VMAX - in order to get OS version and patches installed) and install SW onto Hypermax OS in several clicks (specifying only the minimum of info: where this app is going to run and what resources will be occupied/shared by it).
Also this Store will provide vendors with centralized access to EMC customers that could get interested in apps that can be embedded into VMAX.
1. Money income - this Store might add much to EMC revenue in VMAX customers field.
2. This Store will appreciate vendors develop SW for Hypermax OS as they will be sure where they can find customers for their solutions.
