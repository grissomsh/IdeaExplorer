EMC Library on Premises

I am a huge fan of reading and books and it always came to my mind why we don't have a library where we can share books, idea's, research techniques, and knowledge. 
This idea will help encourage employees to widen their knowledge circles, open up to reading, intellectualism, research skills, and share information. One thing we lack here in Egypt in general is our reading time and skills. Reading is essential especially for employees working at a multi-national company. A library full of books from all kinds of different categories for work and entertainment purposes, in all ways it will add a very positive value to EMC and its employees and its future.
