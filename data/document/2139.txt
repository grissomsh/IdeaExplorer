Community transformation by IoT
•My idea encourages the concept of having predictive analysis using real time data from our community by using cloud computing ,big data analysis & EMC products "2.5 & 3rd platforms" to transform cities & lives.
•An article about "IDC’s Top 10 technology predictions for 2015" was listed there that IoT is one of the most important factors for growth of the 3rd Platform in 2015.
 
Energy:
------
•Governments will need to collect real time data about energy consumptions per each state & with respect to the time by having sensors in each power sources from end users devices &  power sources.
•Implement Smart grids which about adjusting and re-adjusting to optimally deliver energy at the lowest cost and highest quality possible.
•Real time data about water consumptions from the river, suburb & the end consumer level using Level & consumptions sensors.

Security & transportation:
--------------------------
•Implementing sensors & cameras in roads to track the security ,roads status & free parking lots.
•Policeman to add information about roads status through mobile applications & to update the statuses frequently so we can get real time data which will lead to have accurate statistical information about the traffic jam in each suburb.

Water:
------
•Sensors to track the movement of water "floods", contaminants & any conditions in waterways.

Implementation:
---------------
•Centralized databases have all records for citizens national IDs , driving license ID , vehicle plates, citizens addresses to have automated system to facilitate services.
•We can have all these data to be stored on private cloud using EMC storage arrays connected to high speed connectrix switches connected to real-time web applications "databases" with big data analysis "hadoop".We can manage all of these product using ViPR & Secure the private using our RSA appliances & Software's.
•Predictive analysis.
•Growth in cloud computing.
•Governments can take actions based on facts & analysis.
•Increasing the networking of machines and personal smart devices.
