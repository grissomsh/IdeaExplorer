Smart Roads
smart roads will provide less traffic congestion, and will use the smart city IoT to analyze data from many sensors, and then provide decisions. 
we have lots of roads that arent 100% utilized, utilizing them efficiently can reduce alot the traffic jam
we can monitor traffic using hundreds of small sensors, and cameras, each monitoring roads giving which routes are empty, then these data is processed, then a feedback is given to the smart traffic lights, which will re-route jammed roads to less jammed roads.
it will surely enhance productivity and save time, we can call it a solution and sell it to governments, including all the big data analytics and storage included in the design.
