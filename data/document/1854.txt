I wish we had themed meeting rooms (De Bono Hats, Stand Up Room, Retro Room ...)
aligned to contemporary workplace theme 
Idea submitted as part of Idea Generation Session
Meeting rooms are very 'stale' and do not promote creative thinking or 'thinking out of the box'. Themed meeting rooms will promote brainstorming, teamwork, agile working style etc. 
Enhance Productivity 
Foster teamwork 
Promote creativity
Promote agile ways of working
