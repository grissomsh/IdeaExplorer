Mainframe: make JOBLOGs more convenient to read
idea is Mainframe-specific, therefore I am expecting to have some challenges devoted to Mainframe.
There exists an utility called JMFT, which sends JOBLOGs by e-mail. Many ideas are inspired by it (some missing features etc), so improved features are wanted.
Mainframe JOBLOGs are plain text files, called "SPOOL files", containing several logs.
A small simple program needs to be written (Perl or Rexx script, working on Mainframe or on PC) that will insert HTML+Javascript markup.
This will allow to have some summary info handy, as well as instant navigation between elements of the said SPOOL file. 
Additionally, HTML is browsable by any modern browser, providing extra nifty features, such as pretty printing, etc.
Dealing with SPOOL files is everyday task for Mainframers, so improvements in this area are useful.
