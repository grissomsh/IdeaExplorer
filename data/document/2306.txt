EMC Social Portal 
E-Portal enables EMC employees to discuss on general topics
I have seen many Employees in EMC who have ample knowledge on several contexts, whom people contact for advice when needed. But their knowledge remains use-full to their teammates or people they know. But by implementing the proposed idea we can truly bring employees from different BU's under a single roof. 

we can have a portal where EMC Employees can discuss on topics like new Technologies, Gadgets, Movies, Restaurants, Books, Travelling etc. within the organisation.

it will be a database of peoples experience and advice, which will help other employees.
Ex: a review given from a gadget lover or current user of the gadget can help someone new purchasing the gadget for the first time.

Also it makes employees from one BU to become comfortable with employees of another. This  adds to the idea of one EMC family.

Cost expense for the company is very less as all we need is to create a forum which is readily available. we are already using it now for raising technical questions, with some effort and creativity we can implement the same for our social needs.
