Ondemand Teleconference Line
IT Contemporary Workplace Challenge

This would improve the communication and encourage employees to have calls involving required stakeholders without depending on emails.
Optimization and pooling of resources is a very standard solution and can be applied to any place where resources are used and utilization is low.
Provide two kinds of Teleconference lines
1. Heavy - for heavy users(Sales, Marketing teams etc). A dedicated conference line will be allotted to them
2. Normal - Any employee should be able to login to an application and raise a request for a teleconference line with 1 day validity(as an example). The application will give a line from the pool. This is done instantly and doesnt need any approval.
1. Saves cost
2. Every employee can get a conference line for scheduling discussions
