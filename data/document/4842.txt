spot recognitions

there is no spot recognisation in our project for all the good work we do and customer appreciations and onsite team appreciations are not that valued and no recognisation to employees who strive hard and work for the project.
If we spot recognize employees , the boost factor will be more and employees will work with more dedication and accountability.
