Creation of the new innovation culture and improvement of employee’s satisfaction level from ideas sharing with the company

Russia CoE with a help of students from Saint-Petersburg state University, Graduate School of Management conducted a consulting project called "EVALUATING AND IMPROVING INTERNAL INNOVATION IN EMC RUSSIA CENTER OF EXCELLENCE". There were numerous interviews conducted, questionnaires’’ as well as research work done by students. Result of this project – a list of recommendations that should help to improve employees feelings about EMC Innovation roadmap and overall innovation culture.
Idea is to share incubation responsibility among the company (challenge owner, mgmt) and employee himself. We propose to launch Hackathons. 
Internal hackathons are relatively easy to implement: they do not require much resources or time. Yet, they provide clear benefits, such as: increased involvement, collectivistic viewpoint on the problem (“fresh look”). The practice encourages people to take risks. And as Hackathons are usually conducted in a short time-frame, the practice applies the culture of “fail fast”, shortening the learning curve. At the end we always get a working prototype which is about fast incubation to validate the idea!
It usually consists of preparation stage, main stage and result sharing. During a preparation stage an organiser should inform (via portal, emails, etc.) employees about upcoming event. Participants then share ideas in digital platform, comment them and form teams based on same interests, ideas, competences, etc. During main stage teams work towards implementation of their ideas (creation of working prototype!), it usually lasts 24-48 hours and for this purpose 1 day is "granted" by the company and 1 day is granted by employee (let's say Friday and Saturday). Then results are presented and winners are rewarded.
