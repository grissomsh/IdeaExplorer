Using Big data for Urban Planning
This idea is about using data analytic to handle a smart city and how to deal with population growth while the increase demand for better infrastructure and quality of life in it.
No specific history for the idea.
My idea is create solution that uses data big to analyze the current data (infrastructure, utilities, population growth, economic situation, GDP growth rate) of any city and predict the futuristic size of expansion and population redistribution depending on its infrastructure and economic activity and calculating the minimal needed budget and plan for the future population growth. this solution will predict a plan of actions and the best results depending on the available resources. Mainly the solution is using the Big Data to plan and prepare for the future instead of the traditional ways.
If the idea is implemented, we'll make more money by having a solution that targets public and private sector of urban planing and real state development, improve customer satisfaction to have a solution that is fully customized for their needs, the use of big data in new fields that would improve EMC big data products and eventually create new products to increase our market share in Big Data solutions.
