Talent-On-Click
This APP will enable all employees to make their skills ,show to the entire organisation.
We have brainstormed around this & then met with this idea.
Our solution:
1.Every employee in organisation registers in this APP by providing 
  a. skills like C,C++,JAVA etc. & also he/she can mention extra curricular things.
  b. Name of the team
  c. Region they work in.
  
2.Also this APP will have facility to drag data from LinkedIn platform for getting technical skill-sets & Facebook,twitter for extra curricular, interests.

3. Using above technique ,we can create  database for employees.

How we are going to use this:

1.We can categorise employees depending on their skills like C,C++. lets make them  closer & any one faces any problem he/she can file queries to this categorised skill -set people's forum.
2.Same way,any activities happening we can connect with people on similar forum ( such as  Anyone has other extra curricular activity to do like trekking,bike-riding,social awareness campaign etc)

3.Make a forum depending on skill-sets,hobbies,interest of people.

4.To take this on bigger level with diversity & fresh talent, we can add college students on this APP so that they can get right guidance from correct/appropriate people so that their carrier will go on right track.

5.Through this Employee can upload their presentations or practical tutor lectures etc. which will help others
It will save Employee time for finding right people.
If this APP built & successfully works for our organisation then we can sell  this to other companies to make money out of it.
We can achieve diversity through this app by floating it to the different colleges.
