Plant Tours.

Passed by a Plant Tour one day and overheard one member on the tour asking another “What did he say?”
Give each member on a plant tour an ear piece that enables them to clearly hear the person leading the tour or else give each tour member a tablet that enables them to use the camera to point and pick something they want to know more of.  Also a selection of languages should be available.  That one person that couldn’t hear everything being said while on a plant tour could make a big difference.
