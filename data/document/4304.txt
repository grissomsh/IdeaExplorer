Exchange Community!

I believe the Exchange Community will offer us or our children unforgettable travel experiences, even life-long friendships, as it has for thousands of our employees worldwide. We are sure they will inspire you in many ways. Join, embrace and respect this fascinating Community and enjoy everything it can offer you. 
EMC employees live all over the world from Cambodia, Brazil and South Africa, to Canada, the US, France and China. We are people on different paths in life, with different cultural backgrounds, different language skills, ages and passions. One thing that we all have in common is EMC and our belief of its values. 
Easy to implement directly through the EMC plateform. Then create and post the Listing, add details, find your match, send inquiries and arrange your exchange. And have fun!
