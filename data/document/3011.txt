Let’s Package the Cloud Service
Customer Service
During Sales calls for Cloud service, I have experienced that customer hesitate in buying high pricing solution especially for manpower and time required for setting up the cloud infrastructure. As a result of same, we tend to loose deals.
The base infrastructure (Microsoft solution) required to build cloud solution can be packaged using PowerShell scripting. PowerShell will enable deploying complete solution including installation of various applications like Hyper-V, SCCM, Exchange, AD, SQL, Azure etc…and configurations as per customer need.
In today’s world Microsoft applications are fully based on PowerShell scripting. So any infrastructure which has Microsoft flavor can be managed easily using PowerShell.
