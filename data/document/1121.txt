EMC Book of World Records
This idea will create a venue for friendly competition, which opens a path to a greater dialogue between EMC employees of all nationalities, ethnicities, etc. 
By talking to a colleague
My idea is to create an EMC Book of Records, similar to the Guinees Book of Records. This "book" will contain records such as biggest deal value, or largest team photo, or any other record of this sort. The goal is to create a team building exercise which will encourage the involvement of all employees from all ethnicities, sexes, etc.  
My idea is to create a fun way to encourage friendly competition, which can reflect positively on job performance if two teams are competing for biggest deal value for example.
