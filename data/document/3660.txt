Isilon Spill over of the data to other Nodes in the Cluster

There could be instances that the data which is latest will be accessed more frequently and the data which is old will be accessed less. 
In this scenario the node pool which is designated to write the data got filled up and the data which is incoming will be spilled over to the 
node pool which is low in performance. As this is the latest data which is written on the lower performance node will be impacted when there are 
many read hits coming and there is a performance impact. For this there could be a policy which can be set that the latest data will be written on the
high performance node pool and pro-actively calculating the data which is old and less accessed will be dumped to the lower performing node pool.
