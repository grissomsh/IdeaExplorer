Using big data to discover new opportunities

I thought about the idea when I noticed that there are many people around the world who don't know or even thought to visit Egypt, due to lack of information " budget required to visit the country", wrong information, or even not aware of the country location
Big data will be employed effectively to discover new segments of every country who sends tourist to a specific country. Through this analysis we can determine and organize new programs for such new segments with new facilities and innovative way to attract them. New countries can be attracted to use the service and go to these countries based on the analysis made for this purpose.
