Adding shortcut keys for VDP and VDPA web client based applications.

Just a thought

Solution:-

Provide key board short cut keys for creating backup, restore, replication and reports.
Users must be able to launch the respective wizards from any UI screen.
For example if the user wants to create a new backup or edit a replication job and he is currently in the reports tab, a short cut key must immediately open up the corresponding wizard
and provide access to users/admins to perform the action.
Another use case can be viewing the reports from which ever tab the user or the admin is currently in. 
A configurable or a per-configured short cut keys will really boost up the application in terms of customer UI experience.

This idea can also be extended to all the EMC applications that run on web browsers.
Clariion, VNX, DD, Avamar, Networker etc
