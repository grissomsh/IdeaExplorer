Donate for the needy

Charity work and how it positively affect the community
The idea is to engage the CSR committee in collecting stuff for the poor people.
We can have a special week of the month where the committee is responsible for encouraging employees to donate old clothes, new ones, blankets,shoes, whatever stuff that the poor people will need and have them distributed to different orphanages and homeless shelters.
