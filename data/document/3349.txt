 Train your Brain at Egypt COE.

 I am in love with puzzles and mind-teasing applications/websites that’s it. That’s why I seek any approach that uses the human curious nature to motivate employees towards the desired target.
 
This will help employees train their brain, have fun and compete. this is a key employee motivator that can help improve the work environment


the puzzle contest will target all employees in the COE. a puzzle is announced every week/month. employees will compete to answer it. the winner will be rewarded with a small gift. this can be then scaled to be global contest held by innovation team.
the puzzles will target certain skills such as thinking out of the box, innovation and problem solving. It will not be a field specific puzzle so that all employees can participate.
