Zoning is an essential part of the SAN infrastructure, and is required for every host/appliance/Storage in the Customer's environment. Automating the zoning part for E2E horizon, can contribute to this process by saving time with error free output.
The idea was originally for a customer that required a lot of zoning for his daily tasks, and automating this part saved a lot of time and ensured error free outputs. An Excel Macro prototype that is actually working and being used can be found @ (https://inside.emc.com/docs/DOC-148254) which generates 1:1 zoning and customizes up to Zones naming convention
Zoning Automation is a script that generates zoning commands for both Brocade and Cisco Switches, only Aliases and WWN for Initiators and Targets are required.

An Automation Zoning Script can take part of other tools wizard like RP DM with VMAX, and will be essential for medium/large implementation. The script will save a lot of time with error free outputs, and can be inter
