Mobile application connected to our cars
RSA IOT CHALLENGE AND EGYPT COE SMART CITIES, And CTO "New Business challenge"
APPLE idea "where is my iphone now" and also look at my other two idea, securing car industry,and connecting cars over the internet.
my solution is having a mobile application, connected to the internet and hence our cars getting all of these information is a great add on, it would facilitate authentication to our cars, for ex, now VIA -RSA product- we can authenticate to a web page over the internet using our mobile phone, this can be used to authenticate to our cars, giving a specific privelege.
selling a whole package of ideas like connecting cars to the internet also securing access to it with a mobile application to manage all of that, to a car trademark, would involve emc into the car markets, and hence a new financial source, definitely I would like to have such an option in my car
