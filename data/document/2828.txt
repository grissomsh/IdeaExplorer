Standardize on hardware to reduce variation and eliminate customization
By limiting the choices of hardware (fasteners, standoffs, and connectors) in product design will increase volume, reduce cost, and improve quality and availability across the supply chain.
Working in SBMT, this is an issue I deal with Daily,  Working with suppliers to ensure they order all the different parts so shipments aren't delayed.  Struggling to negotiate costs when a custom part is single sourced.  In manufacturing environments where this type of component is controlled, this issue is almost eliminated.
But limiting the list of hardware to relatively small menu of items that fill 90%+ of all assembly applications, we will drive higher volume of these items.  This leads to lower costs, increase quality and better availability of components.  It also standardizes tools and processes in the factories and at suppliers leading to less change over and greater efficiency.  Customized parts should be eliminated entirely.
EMC would publish a part catalog (on line as part of SAP possibly) that engineers/designers would select hardware from.  Customized parts would not be allowed unless it leads to technical innovation and differentiation for EMC.
