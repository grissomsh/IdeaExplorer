Implement Docker Registry Storage Driver for EMC Storage (VMAX, XIO) and for Private Cloud
Russia COE Open Source Challenge:
Customers increasingly rely on world of Open Source, so idea is
to enable open source technologies like Docker to EMC Storage.

XtremIO Challenge:
Docker registry integration option to XtremIO.

APJ COE "Solutions Platfor
We are studying Dockers as part of Development Goal. Doing hands on and understanding the frameworks. So this idea got seeded while doing this study.
Storage drivers are required to implement the storagedriver.StorageDriver
interface provided in storagedriver.go, which includes methods for reading,
writing, and deleting content, as well as listing child objects of a specified
prefix key.

Storage driver could be In-process drivers which are written in go language
or Out-of-process drivers which are implemented in other language (mostly
Java is supported).

Use the Docker Storage Driver framework and Solution Enabler of VMAX and XIO
to provide the backend storage.

Also this idea can be extended to enable for Cloud Array for hybrid and Public
clouds.
This solution if implemented and hosted on github then customer can leverage EMC
storage for hosting Docker Registry. Also EMC's strong data protection technologies will be an added advantage.
