"Power It"
This idea matches the challenge by addressing EMC product energy efficiency improvement
This is the output of combined thoughts
Our idea is to offer a new cooling system attached to any EMC product that increases EMC products energy efficiency.

Hardware:
The system will consist of two cooling methods:
1- Heat sucking fan that works by a battery that gets charged by the server produced heat
2- Water pipes cooling cycles with compressor that will only operate when the fan is not getting enough heat to operate or in case the battery is empty of charge.

Software:
1- Manager to the fan and water systems.
2- Develop an independent software that analyses EMC product usage (I/O, storage usage, Network usage,...) and to match the server capacity with the actual load
This system will increase energy efficiency and eliminate waste in addition to create a new opportunity for EMC to help customers with other servers in their Data Centers.
