Tools & links Automatic updates

When working for several years, some tools and sites that are used for everyday work are updated or new links are used instead of old ones. 
Instead of having both old and new, the update should automatilally replace the old tool or site. 
 
When you download a new tool replacing an old one, it should be linked to the old one to remove it. Same for a link that is used and will be updated to a new one, just replace the old link automatically.
