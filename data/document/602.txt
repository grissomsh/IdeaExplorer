An innovative working environment 
The idea focuses on building a workplace of the future, where innovation would be a core component. At present a large number of employees only get the opportunity to be innovative annually for the innovation roadmap. Innovation should be ongoing to ensure EMC continues to produce and develop outstanding products. 
The idea came to me while working in the Ireland COE.
The solution of creating a more innovative work place would involve; integrating innovation as part of the Ireland COE culture where all teams show a level of innovation continuously. More collaboration is required between teams to increase innovation. Could bring in experts in idea generation sessions and innovative behavior. More brainstorming sessions should occur, innovation should be encouraged and all members of the team should participate. 
Innovation methods should be studied, published and practiced. 
Successful innovative ideas should be celebrated.
Innovation opportunities should be given to every team in the Ireland CEO.
If an employee has an innovative idea relating to an existing product or a potential new product, gap in the market or anything that can benefit EMC, the channels to voice the idea should be made clear to employees.

The successful implementation of the idea would see innovation promoted and encouraged by every team in the Ireland COE. Teams would collaborate more to allow for cross team innovation and allow employees gain a greater understanding of different products.
It would see EMC continuing to develop new, innovative products to keep ahead of the curve and retain their competitive advantage.
Employee moral would also improve as employees would be given the opportunity to provide their opinions and ideas. 
More innovators would begin to emerge.
A culture of innovation would be developed.
