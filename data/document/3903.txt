Thermodynamic Heat Energy Capture From Array Exhaust

I (David) am consistently a warm person, and love passing through the data center in the summer - I thought it would be brilliant to apply it to the end product. Currently multiple fans exhaust heat from the arrays but they don't channel or harness the arrays - even though they put off a lot of heat. I thought about how regenerative braking works on my hybrid car, and thought it might be cool to regenerate electricity from our storage arrays. Kevin and I found some thermodynamic technology companies that have put the instance in place and we thought it could help us drive costs down and reallocate financial resources for investment in the third platform. It also can help our customers. Currently we don't have the technological background for internal evaluation or implementation.
By capturing heat through an exhaust pipe built on to a storage array, we funnel the heat to a condenser and then to water tank. The exhaust gas is passed through a heat exchanger powered by a host engine, and creates superheated steam. The steam is rapidly expanded which drives an alternator that propels a motor that connects to the power grid. The grid feeds electricity back into the host system to power air conditioning, and electricity for the arrays.
