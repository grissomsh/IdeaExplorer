Effective and quick Email management

When we receive lot of mails regarding the same subject, in order to minimize it we can use this idea which eliminates repetitiveness
Without this for the same subject if there are 10- 20 mails by different people it takes lot of time to read those mails. Instead if our mail box shows only the latest mail then we can easily go through which will reduce our time also.
