EMC Ovens Signposts
This idea addresses the Communication and Workplace 2.0 challenges. It helps to promote the EMC Ireland Ovens facility. 
I recently referred a friend for a job in EMC. He was shortlisted for an interview in the EMC Ovens facility. On approch to EMC from Cork City on the N22 he noticed that there was no sign posts directing him to the main EMC entrance.  
Clear signage with directions to EMC should be erected on all approach routes to the EMC Oven's facility and also on the roundabouts adjacent to EMC. These signs could also be used to promote/advertise EMC with quotes/captions etc.
Clearer directions to EMC, Promote/Advertise EMC on the N22 bypass.
