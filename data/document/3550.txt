 Seamless SR turnover for better CSAT

 The idea came up from the daily work tasks in the technical support 
The idea works as follows: 

-	Use unified web portal for SR turnover ( no emails )
-	The TSE enters only the necessary fields like (SR number and latest diagnosis of the issue and next action due)
-	Once the TSE submits his request, it is routed to the turnover approvers
-	Once the request is approved, a notification is sent to the TSE who will add any details if needed or click “Move to Hold” button 
-	The “Move” button will automatically update the SR with the turnover details (latest status, next action ..etc) and moves the SR to the hold queue for the next engineer.
