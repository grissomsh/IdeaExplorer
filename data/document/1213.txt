Quarterly Knowledge Competition
HR Challenge
We have to be engaged with the services of the new products in order to technically know it. There is no drive to go look into the products.
Quarterly, for every new product or service that EMC has to offer, there should be a competition in order to drive the employees to research what the product or service has to offer. The competition will consist of a quick presentation to be uploaded to a platform, the best presentation should win
More knowledge, less training needed if i have the right drive to know about the products.
