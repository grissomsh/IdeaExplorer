Incentivised Car Pooling

During one of our brainstorming meetings on this yearâ€™s innovations, this was one of our suggestions. It is not the first time this probably has been brought up, but over the last few years EMC in Ovens has had to expand its car parking facilities. Now is a good time to bring this back on the table to help reduce costs, reduce CO2 emissions within EMC and educate drivers on CO2 emissions. We have contacted the facilities dept. to get their car parking policies and copies of other Car Pooling ideas they have. Also, we have contacted Security to see how this could work with their help. 
It address the problem differently by educating drivers of the amount of CO2 emissions a typical car emits in a year, a standard car can emit three metric tonnes in a year on the National Road Authority figures for the  average kilometres travelled  per year.  It improves the safety in the Ireland COE by reducing the number of cars entering the site. It can improve the perception of EMC by highlighting the steps they are taking to reduce the CO2 emissions in the campus. It can reduce the cost to EMC COE if they have to build more Car Park spaces by reducing the number required. Those who avail of this facility will have prioritised guaranteed parking spaces closer to the main entrance.  It reduces the costs to the drivers who avail of this service with other drivers.
