Power Optimization at data center
As we facing challenges in terms of optimizing power in our data center, Implementation of these ideas would reduce power usage at optimum level.
Being a Lab system Engineer we have faced challenges in adding new equipment in data center due power supply shortage.
Below are few tips for optimizing power at data center.

-Replacing old rack servers with blade server (Cisco UCS) where ever applicable, this would save almost 30% of power.

-Purchasing data center equipment’s which has energy star certification can reduce power consumption. As per Energy star experts star certified equipment average 30 percent higher efficiency rates than standard equipment.     

- Maximum energy data centers consume goes to system for cooling and managing air. Implementation of cold-aisle containment systems that enclose aisles around server racks to prevent hot air from mixing with cold.   It helps organizations optimize the refrigerated air they produce to keep servers cool.

-Need to fine-tune and bring in faster process for de commissioning old servers and storage equipment’s which are not used. This will optimize power utilization.

-Replacing standard storage to Xtrem IO (SSD technology) this will reduce 82% power consumed and 82% less cooling capacity required.

-Replacing traditional network infrastructure and fabrics to SDN (software defined Networking).

-Develop and deploy monitoring tools to capture performance, temperature and power throughout the data center. 

-Using social media, blogs, e –newsletters and other tools to encourage coworkers to conserve energy.

The above option will produce fast returns in the form of cost saving and power reduction.
