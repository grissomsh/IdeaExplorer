EMC Transport can be combined with the Metro Train

This idea is by hectic experience in traffic and travelling every day almost 50 kms to and fro and better usage of the infrastructure and the facility provided 
Now Metro trains in Bangalore have started operating from few areas.What can be done is employees who are staying near by areas where Metro train operate can travel in that and come to Byappanhalli from there the transport cabs or bus can be provided for pickup and drop.
By this the transport distance also can be saved and cost effective as well
