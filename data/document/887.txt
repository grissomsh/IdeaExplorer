Mobile App for more flexable IT Workplace
My idea will help in making the IT work place more flexable for their employees, with less restrictions. As they will not be commited to work from one place.
The idea came up as we spent so much time as an employe on our workstation which might make things less boring and a daily routine. No one was involved in it.
My solution is developing a mobile application for all mobile platforms, were we can support customer 24 hours where ever and when ever we are, were we can connect to the VPN and service ceneter all the time, so that we can satisfy our needs in parallel with customer needs. So the employee will have the choice either to be restricted to his work station or either to feel free around his work place or outside the workspace with a continous access to his work. so he will provide same performance maybe better one while satisfying himself and the customer as well. This Mobile app can gather all tools used by the employee, for example different tabs, one for lync , one for webex, one for service center, one for accessing the mail and for every other tool we are using in our daily work, So that we can do the same work we are doing on our work station by moving freely around the place or even out side the campus.Also it would help if an employee forgot to submit or update something that he can access his work in a fast and easy way to perform it.
As now a days everyone is holding 1 or 2 mobile devices so it will be easier for us to access our work, cases or job using the mobile phone. This will let us enjoy our daily work with the same performance or may be better. and this may reflect on the customer satisfaction as well.
