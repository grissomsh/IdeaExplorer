Skills Smart active
If we can link or integrate Skills smart with certain sections of Propel or BI reports that provides us the RMs all the relevant information we need while staffing.
The idea is to add an extra button that pulls up certain information about the resource’s schedule either from Propel or from BI reports.
Because  skills Smart is the most effective and easy tool – 80 % times faster to handle any complex requests – but with no resource calendar or assigned project details.
Company Perspective: Time is money – so cost saving owing to faster results. Improvement in Productivity and efficiency of employees. When we are already using a tool and paying for it why not we make a better use of it.
Team Perspective: The delay that we face and complexity of search that we go through in Propel will be reduced to a considerable extent. – Especially for Complex staffing. This will also save a lot of time and team  will be able to use a single tool to have all that we need for staffing.
Individual Perspective : Since we will get some extra time NOW (which was earlier lost in searching & buffering) I would like to take an opportunity to learn other avenues of RM as per my interest.
