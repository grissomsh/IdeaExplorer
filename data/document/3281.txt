Self-Responsive Lync

Came out of problems face is day to day activities.
The idea is,

Lync should first analysis the severity of the messages i.e., the once that are marked with High Importance.

On analysis it should be able to automatically redirect the mail to the next immediate person available in the same team.

This would avoid the person in trouble having to send out an a mail to the person mentioned in the Out Of Office message.

Benefits: 

This would save a lot of time involved in e-mail circulation.
