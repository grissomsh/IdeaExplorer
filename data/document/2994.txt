Next Generation MFG DIAG SW-- OpenDIAG
match GPE Sponsor Challenge "Next Generation MFG Test Process that leverages the power of HW M&O. 1. MFG test architecture for CI platform isn't avaiable. 2. no standard for MFG. 3. MFG DIAG SW is only used in EMC
this idea comes from two situations 1). CI platform is coming, a question that EMC DIAG SW need to have an adjustment  2). EMC DIAG SW Cumulus/Echidna/Platypus are all limited to EMC. it has difficult to be used out of EMC.  so an idea come out that EMC DIAG SW values can be extended to cooperators/customers. it's happened since 2014. Andrew/Chao/Bryan/Gipp/Anders/Hongtao/Jiayin/Wilber are involved.
Take the common part of MFG test to make a protocol/architecture for DIAG SW, such as power cycle, operator-oriented display, message format, log display, tracking mechanism. Separate the common part and platform-specific part, building a service-oriented architecture, provides common interfaces. EMC/cooperators/customers can do redevelopments based on common standard/architecture interfaces, and provide different solutions according to EMC/cooperators/customersâ€™ requirement from functional verification to Hardware quality. compared with EMC present MFG DIAG SW cumulus/echidna/platypus, it will be more common, and will be adapted to 3rd CI platform
1.New DIAG SW for CI platform.
2.Diag SW is not limited to EMC, other companies/cooperators  can do redevelopments base on this SW.  duplicate works can be avoided for common parts of MFG tests. make money on this. it will have great benefits from busines
