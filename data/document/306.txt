Employee Exchange Program
Diversity at the work place is always a good thing, and EMC is always working on connecting and bonding its employees together on their local office. So what about different offices, we should take advantage of the fact that EMC is an international corporation and has different offices around the world.
I was inspired with this idea because Iâ€™m joining a new team with only 4 people on the team, and my mentor from another office from another country. And i think it would be great if we had this experience as a new team in the office to learn faster so we could have a consistent performance across all offices.
Every Month (can be changed depending on the agreements between the two offices) we will have an Employee Exchange between different offices of EMC around the world. The period of the program can vary according to how much the two offices are consistent in performance and if they need exchange or not.

The Requirements of the exchange program can vary according to the corporation but the main requirements are:
1- Employee can only exchange with another employee in the same team or business unit.
2- Employee can only participate in the exchange program if he/she has a good performance and has a sufficient feedback from other colleagues that he/she can share the knowledge gained from this experience.
3-Employees must be prepared to work in different areas.
4-This program should be open to all employees.
Employees awareness of different cultures and environments has a great impact on motivation and creativity of our employees. This is a good differentiator for EMC, the employees and the customers.

Benefits:
*Communication and connection between employees within the federation.
*Employee and Corporation Development.
*Sharing the different working environment experience with their local office.
*Sharing the knowledge gained and benefit their local office. 
*Consistency into EMC offices.
