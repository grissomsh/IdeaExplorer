External Tiering in XtremIO
This idea is to enable XtremIO support,  large scale datacenter consolidation with varying application types through external tiering
The idea evolved during the XtremIO Blended solution sizing, as most of the request would be for top 30% volumes to XtremIO and remaining would be on VNX or VMAX. So though XtremIO as a frontend would manage the top 30% workload volumes and remaining would be handled by array configured as external tier.
Have the support for External tier in XtremIO, similar to FAST.X in VMAX3. But in this case the frontend controller will be XtremIO and not a VMAX3.

Operational Workflow:

1. Identify the busiest (top 30%) volumes to be moved into XtremIO and an appropriate replacement array (VNX/VMAX) for the remaining volumes.
2. Storage pools from the new replacement array will be made available to the XtremIO as external tier.
3. Bind busiest LUNs to XtremIO tier and the remaining LUNs to external tier
4. Fingerprint space is allocated for all incoming IOs in XtremIO 
5. Memory Mapping table will have:
    a. LBA to fingerprint mapping 
    b. Fingerprint to the Physical Location(either XtremIO or the External tier)based on the binding of the LUNS
6. Any redundant data to both XtremIO and external tier are deduped by validating existing Fingerprint and a new fingerprint is created only for unique data.

As XtremIO is used as frontend, inline data deduplication and compression would help consume less physical capacity in XtremIO as well as in external array resulting in lower TCO and footprint.

Additional cost involved for the Virtualization hardware like VPLEX is eliminated.
