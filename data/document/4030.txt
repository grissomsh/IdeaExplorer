Install Base <<Item Instance>> Structure

we always search for ways to automate our process
Changing the structure of  Install base item instance to differentiate the Software Items from the Hardware so it could be automated once the case is received.

for ex SW Item instances to start with 02-XX and Hardware to start with 01-XX.

that will help to easily automate the SW cases once it come in.
