Introducing variable deduplication in xtreamio
In xtreamIO we have fixed deduplication on 8KB blocks we can have variable deduplication
While learning xtreamIO i have come across xtreamIO dedupe .In xtreamIO video ILT i have realised regarding fixed dedupe.While i already worked on DD and avamar i started comparing this dedupe with BRS products hence I think if we have variable dedupe we can make most out of it which will make our customer happy 
We already have avamar and DD in deduplication race.While all our storages are in fixed dedupe race ...It will be first product which will come with stronger dedup . We can have inline varibale dedupe and it will run on entire array so it will be a global dedupe
We can get more out of SSD and this will improve dedup ratio and hence data reduction ration in xtreamIO
