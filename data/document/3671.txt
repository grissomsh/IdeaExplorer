Integrate EMC Isilon OneFS CLI with OneFS GUI.

This came to my mind recently when i was working on a Celerra and had to toggle between the GUI and the CLI for various tasks. The old school NAS storage that had this feature that was quite handy.
However the later VNX's and Isilon's dont have this add-on. I dont see a reason why it should be removed. Although I do understand most of the CLI tasks can now be managed through GUI. But, ask an admin, he/she would probably admit to using CLI more than GUI. 
Personally, if you ask me or any other Unix lover, CLI gives a more aesthetic feel while working on a Storage box rather than using the Web-GUI like old grandpas and grandmas ;)
Bring back integrated CLI with the GUI!!!
Consider a scenario where access to the Isilon Cluster is only through a secured management station.
The management station is in a secured private network and does not allow external sites or downloads.
A storage admin logs in to the management station and realizes that he needs Putty to run a few traces or modify certain parameters on the cluster (For ex: 'Adding static IPv4 routes to all nodes' that is available only via OneFS CLI)
Since the management station does not allow installing application from the internet, he has to raise a ticket with the IT team and have the "authorized" Putty tool installed into the management station. A lot of unecessary time getting approvals just to run a few commands. Not really worth the struggle dont you think?
