EMC Olympic day
Sports is one of the activities that encourages diversity and increases bonding between team mates. 
The idea came to me upon participating in the Olympic day organized by Cairo CoE Club
Organizing a one day olympic event in each CoE. Diffrent teams will compete in traditional sport events and mind games as Sudoko and Chess.
The qualifiers from each CoE are to gather then each year in a different country for the global EMC olympic day.

People from different countries happen to meet and compete under the Fair play motto increasing bonding and enhancing collaboration while discovering the different talents and diversity that EMC has
- Focusing and discovering the diversity
- Building a healthy work environment
- The healthy environment reflects on the productivity and customer satisfaction
