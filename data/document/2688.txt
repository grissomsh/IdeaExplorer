Supporting VMAX V3 Capabilities for Open Stack
We are trying to move to platform 3 in the solution space. Open stack is the right direction which will provide a solution is to build an enterprise-class, scalable, and cloud infrastructure that support latest VMAX V3 array and capabilities.
Was looking for Open stack solution which can utilize SMI-S for exposing the array capabilities on Cloud. Read about CINDER, which can be used to do the same. 
Supporting VMAX V3 and its capabilities for Open Stack. This will help provide all the features like FAST, Work Load provisioning, latest SNAP VX features for applications on Cloud.

We can use the existing CINDER framework enhance and support VMAX V3. CINDER Already provides "block storage as a service" and will bring in all its wonderful features like High Availability, Fault Tolerance, Open Standards and components based Archtecture into play.

We will have to build API to communicate with CINDER. This can be done  using the latest SMI-S provider.
OpenStack provides an Block-as-a-Service solution through a set of interrelated services.

This solution enables customers to build an open-source cloud environment and validate the environment for performance, scalability, and functionality.
