Audio/Video Hangout

-
So basically anywhere around the world there is this smoking area, where employees get to smoke and mingle with others.
We can add a "smoking buddy" to this area 
we could add it at the entrance also, shouldn't be the smoking area anyway as i don't smoke :)

This is a device having a big screen, a good camera , mic and speakers
Everyday, 2 offices are linked together around the world.

People standing in front of this device can see other employees across the world at the other office terminal and they can talk and have a chat.

This will let people to mingle across the world.
It's also exciting everyday to check which office will we be connected to today.
