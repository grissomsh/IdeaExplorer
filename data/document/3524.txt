 Environment Summary â€“ Better and faster troubleshooting 

 I have been thinking about a way that automates supportability and eliminates areas that waste time and effort in the support process to maximize TCE. 
 The idea is to enable EMC products (such as VNX) to gather environment-related information about the components connected to it such as :

-	Host types
-	Host OS version
-	Type of Switches
-	Type of backup solutions (if any)
-	Any network optimizing tools used (if any) (such as riverbread)

These information will be collected and will be grouped with the usual log file collected. The bundle will be attached to the SR as usual.

This bundle will contain the logs (TSEs used to have) + the new environment summary file including all needed information about the environment

This will save huge amount of time and effort asking the customer.
