Worst Case Scenario Game

I have been calling my sister "Worst Case Scenario Girl" for years.  I call it her superhero persona (Cape Girl), because no matter what happens, she will think the worst (i.e., she sees a bump on her hand and thinks amputation or an oil spill and thinks worldwide drought).  So, when the huge oil spill happened in the gulf a few years ago, we had a conversation about why there wasn't a team to research and invent solutions for worst-case scenarios that might happen.
The students must create a problem (environmental, engineering, loss of technology/data, etc.) and devise a way to solve it within a 3 day period.  This doesn't mean that their solution has to have everything fixed and back to the way it was 3 days prior (no magic), but they must be able to show a solution that correct the problem and has a plan going forward with their next steps.  For example, if they created an environmental problem with lack of basic services, they would have to correct this not only temporarily but show how they would/could sustain their solution.  They can only use what could be realistically (financially/logistically/etc.) obtained given the set of circumstances they create.  And they must use Big Data/Cloud/Trust in their problem, solution or both.  The more innovative, creative, difficult, people/resources affected/corrected...the better.
