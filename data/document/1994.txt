Adding data cache(Storage based) to Mobile phone base stations 
The idea is to introduce our storage to mobile phone base stations as data cache. It greatly impoves the download speed and mobile user experiences. Besides, more smart elements(Routing, filter, specific services) could be added to form a smart mobile base station.
