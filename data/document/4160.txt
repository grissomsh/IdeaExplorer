Add hairdryer in shower room or at least electric outlet for it.

The idea comes from personal experience and experience of my colleagues.
Some people of SPb CoE take a shower in office, but more people (mostly women and mainframe men with big beard) can not do it for a lack of hairdryer in shower room or even electric outlet for personal hairdryer. Staying with the wet hair in the office (especially with working air conditioning system) people have a risk of getting a cold.
I believe that it isnâ€™t a huge challenge to put this idea into practice, but it could make the office a little bit more comfortable.
