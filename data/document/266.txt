Initial Template Upon Opening A Licensing SR Forcing Customers To Add In Essential Information 
This will serve the challenge/s listed below. 
We get a lot of cases that has no information and we need to go back to the customer asking for it and waiting. 

If this step can be avoided, that would be awesome! 
When customers use the Web to open an SR or enter a chat > they are asked to choose if they are requesting a temporary or a permanent license key and what is the product and a template will pop in accordingly. 

So if they need a permanent license key, then the sales order will need to be provided by the customer..etc. and all the information that will be requested by the template. 

Licensing can provide the information needed for each product and can help create the templates. 
will save a large amount of time and effort for the lic. team
Perfect customer service 
more organized process 
no mistakes 
will make sure it is routed correctly 
chat agents can handle temporary requests immediately and close the SR
