Chat Team mailbox for dropped customers
To have an automated reply for all the disconnected chats that occurs.

The usual scenario is that we send an email to the customer from our email and customer sometimes reply back with their questions and this is a long loop as sometimes we are not able to assist the customer immediately or we go off shift , the correspondence go back and forth till the issue is set or resolved. This may take 1 or 2 days .

it came to me as we do face disconnected chat from customer end , and we send them email asking to rejoin chat , sometime customer reply to those email with their request , While we can be off shift or sometimes the request is not clear so the Correspondence go back and forth . 
I was thinking to have like a shared inbox , and we can add to the moxie the Drop chat option which will generate the Disconnected email associated with the chat case number . 
We can also have a daily rotation , where the CST can work on this queue, cleaning it up and assisting customer with their requests , maybe 1 hour each daily.
It will be more easier and efficient to both the customer and the CST who got the chat dropped.
