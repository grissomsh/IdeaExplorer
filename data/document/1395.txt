Captiva used to have a solution for small business users. Latter it got removed by prod management
Make captiva and Documentum as a suite and provide to customers as a click once deployment. This will help more customers to adapt our product more easily
ECD products will have more penetration into the datacapture and archiving market and take over from competitors
