Psychiatrist on premises

Most times I'm not able to leave my bad day behind me when coming to the office, but in some instances that is just not possible, we are humans after all. During those times we need to have a talk with someone just to clear stuff off of our chest but thats never possible during the work day when we are 100% focused on working. Having the psychiatrist will solve my problem and improve my productivity/general mood.
Simply appointing a psychiatrist to be available on premises during the week (or a limited number of days per week if the whole week is not possible). The psychiatrist effect would be crucial on days when enmployees are suffering from work stress or generally having a bad day. The productivity of said employees would be improved by a simple visit to the psychiatrist, not to mention that this would improve the overall mood at the office.
