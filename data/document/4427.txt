Internal Trainers

I have got this idea when I reading the challenges.
Open some opportunity for the internal trainers. I am sure many of the people inside EMC are capable / experienced / talented to deliver best trainings. Give them open opportunity to nominate themselves for the internal trainer position, interview them, evaluate the strengths and capability, train them by the trainers and utilize them. We can utilize those talents in their free time. Pay them as a reward for their additional contributions. This definitely saves huge lots of money to EMC besides increasing the knowledge and confidence of those people who opted as trainers.
