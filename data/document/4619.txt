Using Data mining and Business Intelligence techniques to resolve errors during test

I had this idea while discussing possible solutions for debug tools with engineering.
Using the existing data contained in the Log files from previous test runs and the information contained in the Global reporting dashboard. A BI tool could list possible solutions for an error based on how the error was resolved previously.
