TSEs COE Exchange program 
as the sponsor wants a model to get a solution to see how to get advantage of the gender and diversty in EMC 
was thinking of getting a non permanent reloaction program for whom dont want to immigrate , but need to get engaged more with their colleagues in other countries 
For the employees who are willing to relocate for a small period of time (ex : 3-6 months ), to go and work in the target country premises , preferable to be in the team which his product is supported,  while he is still with the same benefits , salary , ...etc ( which the original contract between EMC and the employee mentioned ) 
This will result in engagements between employees from different cultures  , specially TSEs , breaking ice , and benefit from experience between each others , 
know the working environment in other COEs , and have a good relation between employees , as they will be in the same place for an acceptable period of time , 
Finally , all that will not affect the workload , and qulaity of work negatively , as it will have a great impact on people , relationships between them, which finally will affect their productivity 
-will result in engagements between employees from different cultures  
-Benefit from Diversity , and different cultures occured in EMC 
-knowing your colleagues in other counteries and buliding good relation with will have a great impact on people's productivity
