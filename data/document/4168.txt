Service Delivery Automation (Virtual engineer)

For over a decade, service providers have been constantly introducing all sorts of automation to reduce routine or recurring tasks, to increase productivity and reduce labor hours. Additionally, automation has been brought to bear to more expediently diagnose issues or find the root cause of a problem to reduce the time to delivery. This is not new in the IT services industry, because there has been a constant quest for incremental innovation as well as more transformational ways to recalibrate existing offerings or create new ones.
