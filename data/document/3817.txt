Leverage employee resource in trainings

They were some times we looked at the training calendar but didn't get what we want, sometimes the charge of some traing also made us hesitate to register.
On one hand, our company spend a lot of money to buy external training resource but we may still think that the variety is not sufficient or they are expensive. On the other hand, Most people have some technologies or skills that they are proud of but don't have opportunity to show to others.
What we need is just a platform for the resource and requirements. on this platform, people can deliver knowledges/technologies/skills they are good at, also can raise requirements for some specific kind of knowledges/technologies/skills.
popular training or requirements would get higher rating, high quality training would get some kind of prize & honors which would stimulate further high quality training.
