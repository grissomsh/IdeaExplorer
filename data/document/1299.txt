IOT Architecture for Security
BUSINESS+DOTCOM+IOT = SUCCESSFUL ORGANIZATION 

This is the mantra for our design, data center and appropriate security is where all future magic is expected to happen for IOT/ubiquitous than any other area. IOT is nothing without the inetrnet actually supporting the distribuion of information

Our thought process --> Problem statement-->existing EMC/RSA technologies including recently launch INFINITE IOT OS platform -->Solution(to address typical threats such us spoofing identity, tampering data and lack of matured/standards of technology in this area.

Our solution:

1. RF+RSA authentication/authorization framework. 
2.Datacentric approach routed via EMC access point(location based) 
3.Security with easy authentication and identity protection 
4. Scalable to things identity, 5 sense identity enabled with redefined RF/Wireless technology.


1. Redefined IOT security + data centric IOT solution -> Enabler for existing Storage business in new area such as Smart cities, health care and etc.
2. Future Potential business in $ bn.
3. Security solution for IOT world - Redefined RF + with existing RSA technology solution.  
4. Unique and early advantage for EMC/RSA in this business segment.
