Graffiti space

I came up with the idea as I noticed that many beautiful graffiti pictures are now spread in different egypt streets allowing the people to practice their skills and reflect their ideas and feelings.
EMC should provide blank spaces on the walls in each floor dedicated for graffiti drawings. All employees are free to draw what they want to help them expressing their ideas and views.
