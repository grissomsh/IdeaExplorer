Leave Plan.
Utilization of resources and increase in Employee Satisfaction.
Industry wide practice, followed in most of the companies.
Currently employees are given option to carry forward 5 days Annual leaves to 1st quarter of the next year and if not availed it will be lapsed.
Instead we can increase the duration to 2 quarters to avoid resource crunch, last minute leave rush and better utilize the resource to help the business run smoothly.
If Employees are not able to take leave, these 5 days leave should be entitled for cash payout.
This will lead to better resource management and employee satisfaction.
