COE Social platform to replace the Newsletter

We have been trying to change the format, content, size, and frequency of the quarterly newsletter for the last few years to get more traction and to encourage more people to read it and to know about what is happening in the COE, but with little success. Given that the employees in the center are very young and using social network and mobile technology all the time, I thought this might be a good way to reach out to them through the channel that they use the most.
By extending the scope of the "INSPIRE" (Egypt COE Social platform that will be launched in Q3) to include also the content that is currently in the quarterly newsletter, and by allowing employees and BU/functional managers to publish directly on the new platform, the information will be more up-to-date when its published and we will save the time of collecting, consolidating, formatting and publishing that is consumed currently. The content can also include video contents and employees can publish their own success stories and discuss/comment on the published new online. We can also include at a later stage a mobile access to make it more convenient for the employees to use it any time.
