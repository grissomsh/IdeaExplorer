Cabinet Front Door Repairs & Conversions within Manufacturing
Cost Savings Idea
James Knight was the project idea originator and lead. James saw the need to not only reduce our scrap cost but better utilize our on hand inventory. This also and is a greener solution by reducing our scrap volume.
Establish a process by qualifiying a vendor to both repaint and repair cabinet front doors and also convert excess front doors that have demand from one part to another. By doing this it will reduce our front door scrap cost and utilize excess front door inventories.
This process has been implemented and will save the company ~ 115K in annual savings.
