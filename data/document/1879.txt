Organizing tours of the manufacturing floor to the public
Inspiring future potential talent for EMC
I have worked at CERN which is seen as both a place of work and research, and a kind of live museum with a mission to educate and inspire. After seeing the scale of the EMC Ireland COE, the diversity of it's people and the fascinating problems that people are trying to solve every day, it was really clear that EMC could benefits from a similar approach. EMC is not only a place where work happens, it's also a place to inspire and intrigue.
Having the public be able to come in and see how things are done, learning about the current challenges and technologies that are trying to solve those would be a great inspiration for future generations to get involved.
The success of this programme would be difficult to measure, it's impact would probably be noted more in the increase in uptake of other educational programmes such as CoderDojo and early talent acquisition projects like the coop and graduate programmes.
