D2 Analytics Plugin
A analytics plugin can be developed for D2 using Hadoop, Spark and a no-sql database such as Cassandra or MondgoDB. Such a solution can then be hosted on cloud infrastructure provided by Pivotal
Came out of a discussion with colleagues - Lakshmikanth and Anjany
D2 as underlying layer can allow the user to provide customizable parameters via D2-Config (similar to a property page) for which analytics may be performed by the user once these parameters are configured.
These parameters may be part of the metadata or part of the unstructured information(index token value generated by an indexer) uploaded in D2. 
A graphical report can be generated over these parameters once analytics scripts are run over the available data and co-relation (discovered if any) could be presented.
It will improve the D2 product. Also, since analytics is being looked up in lot of domains, so multiple solutions can be developed overtime as well. Considering EMC already has cloud infrastructure offerings (Pivotal), same can also be bundled.
