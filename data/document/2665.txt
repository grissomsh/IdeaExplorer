De-duplication and compression in replication and migration
Existing product improvement.
I'm from MRQE Data Migration CTC and focusing on migration solution/system testing.
During testing we found out the migration is really time-consuming and highly depending on the networks as well as many other infrastructure staffs.
So I hope to boost the migration/replication by transferring smaller data.
Boost replication and migration speed by dedupe and compress the data, as such only deduped and compressed data(normally has smaller size) would be replicated and migrated.
Improve performance of the replication/migration.
Not heavily occupy the network resources as before.
Storage arrays can recover faster than before in the event of the disaster.
