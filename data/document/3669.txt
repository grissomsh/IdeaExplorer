Awarding Our Customers

Thinking of different ways to foster customer satisfaction.
EMC has built great relationships with customers all over the world. We do have loyal customers who have been with EMC for years. This reflects their faith and strong belief in EMC. Such customers are special and they should to be treated differently.

The idea is to reward such customers for their loyality. The reward can be extra contract renewal durations without asking them for extra payment. It can be providing them with free new product releases as samples...etc.

It might seem that we are wasting instead of gaining money by such awards. On the contrary, such rewards will have a great positive effect on our customers. They will continue dealing with EMC and this will generate more revenue. They will also benefit EMC by attracting non EMC customers to our products and services. Customers usually follow entities with good reputation.
