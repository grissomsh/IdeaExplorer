Remote Proactive Roster Auto Update
Process improvement, automation and user experience enhancement.
Being a user, I check the roster and find that people are available while they're away because of a meeting and they got too busy to update the roster and block their hours for example.
Remote Proactive Roster to be in synch with: EDU services (Registered Trainings), Outlook Clendar (Meetings),...etc
This integration will minimize conflicts and help engineers work efficiently without missing any commitments.

In addition to, it helps all users find the actual engineers' availability.
