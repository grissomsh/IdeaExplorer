Build a platform to share and exchange knowledge and training
This idea will help to guild the APP development and create a market for custom to find the training material, and build a model for business.
This idea is inspired by the App store theory and I expand it for knowledge sharing and exchange.   


The solution to this idea is to create a market for it, Just a platform like APP store or Apple store. We can provide the knowledge we have and make it to a training course. Others need this course can download and even pay for it. Others have more understanding on other domain can create other training course and upload to the platform. So a market for exchange and evaluate the knowledge course is the key.
The domain knowledge especially with specific area will be exchanged and training will host by ourselves and no need for organizer to find the trainer. Save a lot of effort and money.
