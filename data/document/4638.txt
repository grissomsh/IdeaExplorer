Extended Copy feature is predominantly used in backup, Microsoft Windows ODX Copy and VxVM. By integrating this feature in PPME/EMCopy/RSync we can improve the performance of the host based migration methods
PPME, EMcopy and Rsync is host based migration method during migration the data path is from source Storage - PPME host - Storage. 
By integrating "SCSI-3 extended Copy" feature Data can be migrated directly from source storage to Target Storage by offloading the migration request to Storage array's Copy manager

The benefits of PPME Extended Copy Service will be:

Server-free copy operation. The copy operation is done between the array subsystem and the target disk. The data copy operation does not use any CPU or I/O resources on the host server.
