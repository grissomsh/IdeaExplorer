Annual/Semi-Annual Team Building Event.
The Ireland COE has an issue that there are multiple locations for the EMC federation, which means not all the employees know each other leading to lack of communication on friendly bases.
Team building events in my COE.
Planning an event to gather all the federations in fun activities which will help the employees engagement together and build a successful business relationship based on real collaboration and real understanding that started from an entertaining environment.
Team building events in general helps people to get to know each other and helps them work better together and produce better outcome on the long-run.
