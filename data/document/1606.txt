EMC Employee Culture Enhancement
My idea is trying to get useful of the gender and ethnic diversity that our EMC employees are having around the EMC globe.
This idea came up to me when i thought about the massive number of nationalities inside EMC company and the huge number of customers that our employees deal with each day so from that i thought about how to increase our employees culture to deal much better with EMC customers either remotely or face to face. also i thought about how it is easy for each employee to enhance his culture in funny and easy way cause each country presenter or presenters would show the best of their country and how it is very beautiful and how their history is interesting to any one. 
My idea is to make a cultural forum each year in which each gender or ethnic makes a presentation or show  on the place he is coming from and that either be with same people from the same place he came from or individually but from my humble opinion it is better that people for the same nationality do the presentation or the show together. 
The presentation should have part of the country's history ,their traditions ,the way they love to be treated with ,things they are famous for and the way they think.  
If this idea is implemented  it would enhance EMC customer satisfaction cause if the customer observed that EMC employee know some about his culture he will feel his importance to EMC company.
by implementing this idea all EMC employees will be more efficient to deal with different cultures in a professional way also innovative ideas maybe generated cause each of employees would know much ideas and strange traditions and different behaviors.
