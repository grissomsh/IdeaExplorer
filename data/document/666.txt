IT Service Log Access as-a-service
Our idea could make all IT service user could easily get the server side log under the premise of safety.On the other hand, it can let the service providers getting free from the heavy work.It could greatly improve the working efficiency of both service users and service providers.
I have experienced many times deal with IT guys to do the trouble shooting.Even though IT's colleagues are trying to help,as the time difference and communication and other reasons, the efficiency is still relatively poor. So we have to propose this idea to make it easier.
We can build the log access as a service. If this service is public, the log access will be public. If this service only open up for specific crowd, the log access will need the identity authentication. The service will be provided as a REST or SOAP web service. All the available services, interface definition and example will be put into EMC Inside.
This idea will provide a group of web services.It could make all IT service user could easily get the server side log under the premise of safety.On the other hand, it can let the service providers getting free from the heavy work.It could greatly improve the working efficiency of both service users and service providers.
