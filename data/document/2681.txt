Technology Stack on Demand
Implementing EHC technology would allow a reduction of lab footprint internally while increasing the agility of service catalog deployment to Eng.  By managing both internal and external clouds via EHC, the lab team could shift resources as need.
The idea history came from an EOS2 innovation session held with the PLM Operations team.  The idea is new and being developed for the CTO Innovation challenge.
Imagine a test or dev person going to ServiceNow catalog item that integrates with EHC and prompts the user for a few parameters, pushes the request to EHC and the environment is spun up, confirmed by lab personnel ensuring a complete solution, all within minutes.  The same could be true for external customers to the external cloud securing our internal labs since customers would not have to access our internal labs.  This approach differs from managing disparate budgets, assets, and complex environments that exist today in the lab.  This solution would utilize converged infrastructure, reducing lab tile space, number of assets managed, as well as provide latest and greatest technology for virtualized environments combined with elasticity to external clouds for on-demand during major releases, regression testing, and high customer demand times.  Other uses include providing internal environments for analytics (e.g. alteryx, tableau), dev (compilers, simulators, etc.)
Success would include reduced lab space, reduced manual lab intervention, increased solutions oriented service catalog, increased customer TCE around POCs, troubleshooting, demos, and testing environments.  Side benefit includes reduced admin tasks.
