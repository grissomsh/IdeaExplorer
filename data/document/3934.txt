Context-aware implicit authentication of mobile users

The idea was conceived in a meeting of RSA Labs with two Archie/NGX architects but collectively it reflects the requirements we have identified in discussions with many different product teams inside RSA. We are working closely with engineers to build the prototype and planning to recruit some EMC employees to test a POC implementation.

Our proposed scheme requires an agent continuously running on user’s devise to collect information related to user’s behaviors and context and then build and periodically update a user profile. Examples of collected data include locations, application usage, browsing history, etc. Then, the behaviors and context of the current user is compared with the previously generated user profile to calculate a consistency score on how likely it is that the device is used by the same user. If there is a big deviation, the produced score will be low and the user will be logged out automatically. Here, the agent runs silently as a background service using little resources of computation and storage, thus being complete transparent to legitimate users. We envision our scheme to be integrated into the infrastructure of RSA Archie to provide additional protection and also improve its usability. Integration with RSA SA is also possible through server-assisted user profiling and behavior analysis that employ correlation with other data resources – in this case, on-device (local) data aggregation and encryption can enhance user’s privacy and enable large-scale adoption of the new scheme. Comparing to the existing solutions, it could greatly reduce the number of required authentications for legitimate users without sacrificing the security.
