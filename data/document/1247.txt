Skills Development Map
The idea targets "Upskilling our talent" and subsequently creating the workplace of the future by creating educated and motivated people. Allowing people a road map to success and knowledge for whatever career development they choose.

Confusion with what training is needed for future career/ Brainstorming Session
Skills Development Map proposes a chart representing the hierarchical structure of the company and skills and training needed for career development. Skills needed would be recommended by the existing supervisors/managers and directors. Talent development would feed in real time information on trainings available which would link to EMCU and registration. The idea proposed offers a user friendly interface that serves as informative, real-time and uncomplicated system for people to plan their career development/change. 


If implemented, a fully informed workforce would be created, striving for future career development. Having a system like this in place, ability to leverage "big data" in order to understand our workforce can be established.

This will help employees to understand what skills are required in different BUâ€™s or even Federation Partners. Often employees only know about opportunities in their own group but this would help employees to prepare for roles in other groups because the skills required would be mapped out for them.
