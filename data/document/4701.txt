Diet Corner

I'm trying to diet but the office cafeteria is not helping and leading me to eat unhealthy food that effects my health.
Adding to the catering a diet corner where this could encourage the employee to pursue healthier options. This health corner should contain options for vegans, grilling, fruits and salads to help keep the employees in shape. This way we will get sick less, lead a healthy lifestyle ending to a higher performance level. Less exhausted and more fit employees is the way a multinational company motivates thier people.
