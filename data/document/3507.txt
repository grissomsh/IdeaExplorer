 Big Data Guard - Big Data in Network Security

 The idea came up from studying Big data related papers 
 
The idea works as follows:

-	Utilize the huge amount of logging produced by the network nodes such as switches in the 
-	Periodically move these data to a centralized warehouse for analysis 
-	Run big data analytics techniques such as temporal analysis on the collected data to detect possible threats. For example if w user logs in to the network with his credentials from one place (e.g US) and after 5 minutes the same user is logged in using same credentials from China then there is a possible security breach
-	Corrective actions can be taken like : blocking the user temporarily till further authentication
-	 The tool will analyze the access behavior and spot any uncommon/suspected activity and report it
