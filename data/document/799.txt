Reclaim VMAX devices in single command
Include new command in next symcli version to make reclaims easier
Deleteing devices take lot of time, mainly if it is a meta device.

We already have symdev command used to unbind the device from pool without mentioninig the pool name.
Like if we create new command which automatically dissolves the meta if the device is a meta devices and also delete the meta members.

Algorith needs to be developed to identify the meta devices and meta members and delete it.
Reclaim jobs would be easier
