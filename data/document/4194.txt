Improving FASTVP prediction algorithm

Alexey Romanovskiy saw presentation "Use DBclassify data to provide hints for FAST-VP.pptx" on GINA network, asked Alexey Fomin to elaborate the presentation. During discussion and understanding limitations of the presentation this idea appeared.
No internal implementation or evaluation of idea has been done.
Long time patterns may be detected and constructed by FASTVP algorithm or they may be selected from a set of patterns on per application basis.  In the latter case FASTVP gets hints for application for selecting pattern or sequence of patterns for slice promotion/demotion.
Using long time periodic patterns allows to time-shift promotion/demotion decision one (a few) hour earlier making it more efficient.
