Universal Converged Infrastructure Dashboard for Management and Telemetry services
Easier Converged infrastructure management and effective telemetry services with the help of REST API.
This idea came from the understanding of Openstack cloud offering. They have a single management portal called Horizon which integrates with all the components of Openstack (Swift, Cinder, Nova, Neutron, Keystone etc.) via REST API.
Having Rest supporting hardware makes multi-vendor hardware management through REST API a simpler task. 

With VSPEX offering now we are faced with multi-vendor hardware integration and management. Having to know how to manage hardware at various layers of Converged infrastructure requires knowledge of multiple management tools. 
To simplify this process, we can make use of REST API and set up a single web based portal where users can log in and manage all the Converged infrastructure hardware.

To perform Mining activities we will need to provide a Database software in the converged infrastructure offering to customers. Any alerts that will be generated can be pushed to this database and meaningful reports can be generated. 
We can offer free database software like MYSQL. 
For larger environments we can also consider MONGODB which is known to have deep query-ability.
To perform this, we will need to set up: Polling agents, Notification agents, Collector daemon, REST API and Database like MYSQL. The working of this is clearly explained "Elaborate Presentation" deck. Please follow the link below.

1. One Single interface to manage & report all the Converged infrastructure components
2. Simple and Easier Management
3. Reduced need for multi-product skilled staff
4. More reliable system with failure prediction capability
