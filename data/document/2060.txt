Viability tool for EMC Federation 
Our idea matches the challenge as it addresses the issues of collaboration and communication. Out aim is to improve both theses areas in order to make EMC a more efficient place to work. Our proposed chart will help collaboration between different departments and sites. By doing this, we hope that employees gain connections within other departments and in turn they know who to turn to when a problem arises.  
We thought of this idea through an innovation brainstorming session help on site in EMC. 
Our aim is to make EMC federation chart more accessible and easier to read. By doing this we hope that collaboration and essentially communication will be improved. We propose a slightly different chart structure that would show how each department inter-connected with each-other and also show roles that are similar to your role within EMC partners e.g RSA and VMware.  
We hope that collaboration and communication will be improved through different departments,sites and employees. This would then improve employee involvement and self-esteem needs as they would be included in a wider team than just their department. We would like this to improve EMC revenue as employees will have more connections to solve problems alot quicker thus saving EMC money and time.
