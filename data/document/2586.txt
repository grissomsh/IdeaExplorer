Consolidate APC and SAP data for more insightful KPIs and reports
Managing and improving manufacturing operations requires leveraging both APC test data and SAP operational data.   Currently the data for each is managed independently with different reporting tools that make combining data for the typical business user c
Over the last few months I have been working with Jason Overly and Chris Surati to develop requirements and potential data sources for productivity reports to provide cell leaders and operation supervisors.  Most of the desired underlying data is available but must be sourced from multiple SAP and GRD reports that require consolidating before the final useful summary charts and reports can be provided.  At this stage we have completed proof-of-concept to verify feasibility and confirmed strong interest across the Apex Operations management team.  We are working details to define the complete process to allow such reports to be generated on a pilot basis in a few cells and to share the concept across GPO Manufacturing for additional refinement.
By having both APC and SAP sourced data available via one access portal, the business can then identify new consolidated reports and KPIs that can be generated more seamlessly.  This provides a foundation for a new series of global reporting tools that all manufacturing sites can leverage to further drive down manufacturing cost and to ensure desired outgoing product quality.
Initial success would be realization of the desired productivity reports that can be leveraged across all EMC manufacturing sites and to hear the reports are generating conversations and ideas that are improving plant productivity.  Longer term success wo
