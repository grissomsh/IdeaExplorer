 EMC Lab Service for customers

I have been thinking of such solution when I saw many customers would like to run tests on their production environment and are limited by time and HW components available 


 
The idea works as follows :

-	EMC will build a cloud based lab-as-a-service that will be available for all EMC customers. It will be booked and used online
-	The lab will offere different EMC products and environment setups like :
o	Host 
o	Networking 
o	Storage 
o	Software tools 
-	The lab components will be simulators for real appliances (a virtual machine serving as the desired component)
-	The lab will be available via a web portal
-	The lab will be presented in GUI that is friendly to the customer with drag and drop feature to connects components together
-	The lab infrastructure is intelligent and aware of the compatibility matrix for each product
-	On demand IO simulators
-	Performance dashboard is used for performance analysis and testing
-	EMC can add its own charging mechanism for billing
-	After the booked lab is released, components will be ready for use by another customer.
-	An example of this lab simulator already exists in VNXe KittyHawk simulator
