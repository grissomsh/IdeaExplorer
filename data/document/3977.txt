Sales Deal

It came to me when a thought came to my mind when thinking that the sales engineers take 0.1% of the deals as a commision while we help them a lot during the deal and doing a huge part of the work and that it would be a great bonus and acknowledgment of our work
Basically for everydeal that the team helps the system engineers in they are granted o.ooo1% of that Deal. By making the Systems engineer at the end logging in on the system who helped him in securing this deal.
