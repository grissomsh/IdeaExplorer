Food portal @ EMC

Cafeteria still functioning old way while such facilities are a plenty in the market.
This food portal should allow employees to use their Credit / Debit / Sodexho cards to preorder food. And once one reaches the cafeteria, all they need is to collect the food. This will reduce the long queues at peak hours in EMC ICOE cafeteria, and employees will save a lot of time. Vendors should publish their menu card on the food portal so that employees may choose what they want to purchase. This portal should be available at internet so that we may use smartphones as well to place order.
