Go Green - connecting mobile number to sodexo card.

I got this idea while I was using my sodexo card in my cafeteria. While go green campaign running strong in EMC, I thought this would be useful.
Atleast 3000 people use their sodexo card a day in our cafeteria and all these people receive paper bills indicating the amount used and the sodexo balance. 

Instead of this we may link our mobile phone numbers with the sodexo card and instead of having paper bills we may receive messages on our phone with the amount used and account balance.

This may reduce the use of papers used in the shops and can save atleast 100 paper rolls a day used for billing.

100 paper rolls a day make it 3000 paper rolls a month and in turn in a year we can atleas save one tree which is used for making these paper.
