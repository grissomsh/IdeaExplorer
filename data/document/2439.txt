TCE - Unified VPlex Solution
The idea is to propose the Unified VPlex Solution that improves the TCE. 
Work Experience
Today VPlex as such has the ability to support only the SAN infrastructure. 
Solution / Idea Proposal:

VPlex should have the support for the NAS protocol and also the hardware support for the same to bring in the "Unified VPlex".

Adding the intelligence to the VPlex box to support both SAN and NAS protocols thereby addressing larger customers, VPlex gets expanded in the market. 

VPlex core should have the intelligence to identify and act accordingly for SAN and NAS platforms. This is in par with the NetApp's V-Series which provides a similar solution as that of VPlex except the fact that VPlex is for SAN environment.

On top of the unified system, VPlex can have the features such as snapshots, volume copy etc to have a bigger impact and more robust for data availablity.

This has to be the pluggable solution, where the customer can plug-in and use it accordingly. The customer can pick their usage based on the needs. 
The customers get to have the hold on theor usages. Also, EMC can have a hold while selling the licenses and the solution.

SAN only box [As we do today]
NAS only box
SAN + NAS.

This way we get more profit and the product also gets bigger.
