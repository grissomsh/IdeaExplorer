Complexity of Power Systems virtualization management
      LPAR deployment is "MANUAL" which requires intervention of lab administrator
      Time taken to provision the business requirements
      Difficulty in managing virtual workloads
      Unavailability of Self Service portal and quota/lease system.
      Unable to clone & copy the business critical environments



India EOS2 LAB Experience
 
We spend lot of time in provisioning & recreating the IBM AIX setup for test & DEV environments

Implementing IBM Cloud manager with IBM Power VC & IBM  Hardware management console

Improved Productivity in creating the test & DEV environments from "6 hours to 10 Minutes" by having the LPAR templates & snapshot options

Automated IP management

Dependency on LAB Admins reduced with User self-provisioning

Can have utilization reports on demand which will help for feature procurement
 
Saving in CAPEX by using IBM Power VM virtualization feature (maximum utilization of resources)
