CHILD FRIENDLY WORKPLACE / CRECHE
Focuses on building a workplace of the future. Provide employees with a Child friendly workplace. This would include flexible working policy, working from home, job sharing where possible, acceptance of bringing children to the office and provision of onsite creche facilities.
Suzanne Considine, Robert Creedon, Andrea Graham, Caroline Maunsell, Lorna Murphy, Philip O'Carroll, Conor Roche and Ivan Santry were all involved in coming up with this idea during a brainstorming session at the CTD Technology day. The idea was discussed and developed during this meeting. We looked at the pros and cons of flexible working hours, working from home, bringing children to work and having an onsite creche.
Family friendly workplace policies are designed to help employees co?manage work and personal obligations. Flexible working hours as agreed with employees' managers would allow the employees to fulfill their 39 hour week obligation without having to commit to the working hours of 9 - 17.30. Employees being allowed to bring children to the workplace when they are under pressure to complete a task would mean they could come in for a few hours at the weekend and the children could colour /read/ watch a dvd. An onsite creche facility would eliminate the extra commute time and cost for parents.
Implementing the family friendly policies would  provide benefits such as on-site childcare, flexible scheduling and working from home.  These benefits can lower employees’ stress levels and increase job satisfaction. 

Employers also benefit from family friendly policies by helping them to retain highly-skilled employees who might seek other jobs or leave the workforce entirely. Retaining workers, particularly in specialized industries, reduces companies’ training and recruitment costs. Implementing family friendly policies can also decrease absenteeism, enhance productivity, and improve employers’ ability to attract competitive applicants.
