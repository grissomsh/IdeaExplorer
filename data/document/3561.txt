Employees to generate energy

We got the idea from the an ideation session on how we tackle a funny solution that can involve every one in the organization to know how important to be sustainable. 
We can install stationary bicycles in each floor/flex rooms, each person will login in using his credentials "swipe his EMC card". The kinetic energy of the cycler will help generate electricity and a screen would show employees how much electricity they contributed in. 

The system would then track the KM in cycling for each employee and each KM would be exchanged for points. The employees would then receive a voucher to buy a sustainable product generated from EMC sustainability web site.
