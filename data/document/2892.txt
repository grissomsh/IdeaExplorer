Unified Host Agent for All EMC Array
Currently, manually register hosts on EMC arrays takes a lot of effort.

We already got an "host agent" for VNX,which is able to register host information on VNX array automatically.
If there was a "Unified Host Agent" for all EMC arrays, that would be great.
Here is 2 easy steps for solving the problem.
1) Install "Unified Host Agent" on the hosts which need to register on EMC array.
2) Login EMC array to check the hosts' information. 
Customer could continue other planed work after the hosts' information are checked.
Customer will take minimum effort on registering hosts on EMC arrays by using this "Unified Host Agent.".
