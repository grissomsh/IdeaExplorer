Refer a customer, be a salesperson for our products

As an employee, I keep thinking about the ideas how sales team should market that particular product, what are its pros and cons, If only i would be given the chance to face a customer i will be able to explain the basic details of the product as i have developed/tested and i know it all. An employee can be a real sales person for his/her own developed/tested product.
We have multiple employee referral programs to strengthen our company’s employee strength but a customer referral program is hardly heard of.In this fast pace world we all are connected to each other through one or other networking sites, not just people but businessmen, Entrepreneurs and even companies are connected to each other directly or indirectly via various networking channels like Facebook, Linked-in, twitter, what’s App etc. 

Idea is that an employee can market his/her own developed/tested product on his/her own networking site within certain limits and criteria’s following certain protocols. By doing so we would be able to reach a lot of prospective customers/companies who are in our network, our friends list who thereby can reach their network and share the data. Linked-in alone is a giant collection of people/companies who are clients or customers of many organizations or products respectively. This can be the best platform or market place to sell our products.

There’s a sales person inside all of us but most of us are unaware of our hidden talent. Every talent should be rewarded enough to keep the momentum going hence there can be awards/share for such deals.
