Standardized GUI

I've discussed this with my boss Craig Cotton since we both came to EMC about a year and half ago.
Creation of carefully considered images, layouts, buttons, slider bars, CSS's and other items required to create the best look and feel for EMC's various User Interfaces and a place for them to be housed.  Ideally a person who is responsible for getting BU's to use them as well.  Many things need to be taken into account and consensus should be gained by the BUs.
