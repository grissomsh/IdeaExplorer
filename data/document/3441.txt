Survey Ease

It was hard to find or there was nowhere to find where to submit feedback. Putting the link in a better spot, and for surveys, including a question and feedback box sometimes throughout the year, can help gather necessary information about more specific things.
On certain surveys if applicable. Instead of having one huge survey at the end, at the bottom of different applications and websites, you can have one question along with a bar next to it to add input. This makes it easier to see and gather. Or perhaps the questions pop up randomly, not always, and a user has to answer in order to continue, or they have the option to.
