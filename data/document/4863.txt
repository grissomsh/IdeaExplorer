Hawk eye - Surveillance of dieseases

Ideation was driven by need for such a tool/app, when we see flash news on tv channels whenever such break outs happen. We see a report on how many have lost lives and how many fighting in hospitals but we do not see action  by civic bodies in taking preventive measures.
The data collected by civic bodies and pathology labs will be subjected to analytics module. We can use k-means algorithm, that finds clusters given one or more dimensions. By looking at density of cluster and we can put up a mashup that drills down to specific area using google/yahoo map APIs.

We can extend the app to clinical trials that pharamceutical companies carry out during drug testing process. Documentum stack is used by many Fortune-500 pharma companies to record clinical trials data.
