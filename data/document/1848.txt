Departmental Org Chart 
This idea improves collaboration and communication across the COE and Federation and will help to build a workplace of the future by an innovative new way to connect people across BU’s, sites and Federation partners.
The idea was a product of a group innovation workshop incorporating employees across various teams within CS. The program was facilitated by co-ops. The idea was discussed and refined through group collaboration.
We propose to search for people in a new and innovative way – from the product or department perspective. Example: if you need to find out who works on Isilon and might be able to answer a question you have, you enter the product name “Isilon” and it shows you the relevant groups. Some might be in Manufacturing, some in Customer Service – you select the group most suited to answer your question and it will show you who is in the group and who is available. 
This could also be dome form a BU or department level. If you have a Finance question, you could select Finance to start your search, then drill down through the different departments until you get the team you need to help with your query.
We feel this will open up communication and collaboration channels across the Federation and is an innovative way to connect employees.
The success of this idea would be measured in the ease at which employees could connect with each other. The usage of the system could be tracked to see how many employees are utilising it to connect with others and usage from other EMC sites and Federations partners could also be monitored to ensure success. Communication and collaboration will improve and it will help our customers as we will be able to get the right people to answer the right questions at the right time, therefore improving TCE.
