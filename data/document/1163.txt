New style Inside EMC 
I think my idea relates to the challenge as it helps improve communication as employees can access social outing details and additional work details on the go. It also address the problem of workplace of the future as employees can access details without the need to have their EMC laptop. 
I came up with this idea when I was looking for group pages on Inside EMC and it took a long time. Additionally, I found it very hard to navigate different tabs on the page.  
I propose a new style to Inside EMC page where employees can access the page is more of a user friendly format. I would like this page to contain more color and more easy to read options. Additionally I propose easily accessible group pages. I would hope this page can be accessed remotely from mobile phones and not just from EMC laptop. I would like this page to be more interactive and contain social network feel. 
I would hope this page becomes more accessible for employees thus boosting the number of people that use this site on a daily basic's. Also, by having social content on this page, employees can stay update with the latest events happening in EMC.
