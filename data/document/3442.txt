Employee Expertise Cloud Portal

This idea was generated based on the challenge question and using big-data / cloud / mobile / social applications.
A cloud application (accessible via a web portal) will be created. Employees can enter information about projects they have and are working on, and with customer or industry knowledge and experiences they have. This can include keywords or sentence descriptions. Data will also be entered automatically via employee role descriptions, documents written, salesforce data and other means. A graph of connections will be generated between employees with similiar expertise and this graph can be used to help other employees find and expert in an area of interest. For example, are you looking for someone with competitive knowledge on a specific company, need to know about an emerging technology, or who is working on a specific aspect of an EMC product, this graph will help connect you to the right person within the company that can help with the right information. You simply enter in a keyword search and a page-rank type algorithm will help connect you to the best experts in the company. Expertise rankings can be adjusted based on anonymous feedback from users and on how many situations an expert was able to help on.
