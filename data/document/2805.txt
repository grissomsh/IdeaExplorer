EMC’s hear back to customer methodology.
1. It is very important that we as a Product based corporation should satisfy customer’s changing requirement timely and effectively. For that we should always go back to customer and hear from them.
2. Improve communication across our multiple EMC and Fe
As soon as I see Ireland COE's challenges just sparked these things in mind.
1. Demonstrate new challenges in storage world and the way EMC resolved them through animated videos in such way that anyone could get a better understanding of new technologies and features around to official websites. Also do the same thing for EMC’s important roadmaps concepts.This will give awareness to customer/outside world where we are standing now. Also link these animated videos to Social Medias such "facebook" and "twitter" etc.
2. Arrange more EMC events around the Globe with invited customer representatives to unveil the benefits of new EMC products.
3. Setup debate/tech talks with competitive vendors in front of customers by collecting the changing customer requirements and explain the features of EMC Solutions.
In order to attract new talents we should concentrate on below things;
1. Arrange Seminars in Colleges/Universities and explain the exposures and other social activates that we are doing such as working with NGO’s to help others, Go-Green initiatives etc. in EMC.
2. Add more details in "career.emc.com" such as campus infrastructure, work culture, exposures, benefits, other fun activities to make our work place more comfortable etc. Whoever reefer’s EMC's career portable will get to know about more our family and that may attract more talents.

Definitely improve customer satisfaction and hence EMC can better stand-in forever in Storage Solutions.
