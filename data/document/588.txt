Intelligent lab management system
This idea solves management of large amount of machines in lab
This idea comes when I try to change hardware on a server.
My colleague Long,Wang is also involved. 
This idea is still in mind.
This idea intends to develop a new universal machines monitor and management system.
The system would monitor all the devices in lab including DDR,switch, PDU .etc.
With the help of this system, administrator could easily check all devices in lab and take action at once in case there are any exception.
A universal and intelligent lab management system.
This system could make administrator work more easily.
And if possible, this system could be also sold to customers.
