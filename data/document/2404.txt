Using Graphene-based Supercapacitors technology in the power supplies for EMC products.
-Graphene is the thinnest, strongest material on Earth, with a high-rate of electron transfer – properties ideal for a super battery.
-Attended a TED talk in the American University in Cairo & Dr Maher El-Kady "Post-doctoral Researcher at UCLA" who was talking about this new technology as he developed it so the Idea came to my mind.
-Graphene-based Supercapacitors can store as much charge as a conventional battery & they can be recharged in less than a second compared to hours for conventional batteries.
-Researchers said that someday could power a new generation of roll-up computer displays, or electronic fabrics that harvest and store energy produced by body movements.

I-t can be charged & recharged one million times as based on the researches done, it charges quickly “100,000" times faster than regular batteries and is biodegradable adding to this two more positive things which are easy to manufacture & inexpensive.
