Contemporary Workplace with echo technology , Save cost Go green with trending Equipmentâ€™s
Present CFL light technology consumes lot of electrical energy,  it produces ultraviolet, mercury leakage due to less life space , cant reuse by fixing , recycling and maintenance cost is high  
CFL bulbs produce more heat compared to LED ,  in other words need more cooling methods to keep workplace temperature at certain level
 
With flow of electrical energy in  Different conductors, it produces heat, light, magnetic field, i am working on these concept since i completed education E&E in 1997, only thing is major companies invested on R&D to discover efficient conductor produce more light with less energy by combining  power electronics , it can be redefined with our own research.
Note: Complete innovative case study, recycling , process to implemented @ EMC ppt attached  on below URL

Manufacture  sell  Laptop, smart phone integrated with different vendor patented processors , firmware and storage device etc with their Brand name,  can we have our own implemented LED integrated to 3rd platform and have patent of invention.

Life of LED bulbs is 50K Hrs, if we compare CFL, LED saves 135$ cost
( its old KWR Tariff , please refer latest tariff @ www.eia.gov)
Think every EMC employee need average one bulb illumination at work station and cabins For 70000 employees (70000 *135)  i.e. "$9450000" Saving (excluding Labs, campus and other location) Recycle and reuse by fixing saves further cost(Requires proper handling and recycling methods)
I am implemented own LED lamps with Disposed Soft Drink bottle slice (Coke ,Pepsi) to fix LED, driver circuit 
Working bit on safety concern, Done with motion sensor detection.
Working on how to integrate with Mobile app.(Logic all set)
