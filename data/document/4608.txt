Locating of Manufacturing Materials in Real-Time with RFID

Over the years, RFID has been proposed as a solution to the material location problem through the manufacturing WISE program.  The process engineering groups have evaluated several different technologies which could not be justified due to the significant expense noted above.  While developing a proof-of-concept for a different RFID application, we recognized that with a few modifications to the software we had developed, we could utilize the same hardware components to potentially solve the persistent material location problem.  A proof-of-concept is currently in development which when proven successful will require additional software resources and funding for hardware to bring it to its full global potential.
Utilizing RFID technology to mitigate the problem above is a commonly suggested solution.  However, after reviewing commercially available RFID solutions, it is clear that meeting the necessary ROI is a challenge due to the significant cost of the solution.  These solutions have demonstrated themselves to be highly capable of locating materials to within a 1-3 foot range. This accuracy comes with a significant cost and far exceeds the level necessary to help solve the problem noted above.  Our idea is to utilize inexpensive EPC Gen2 RFID tags, common in retail applications, and an array of UHF RFID hardware.  This combined with software already developed and tested by the Franklin Process Engineering would be able to approximate the location of materials to within a 10-20 ft. range.  This distance would be sufficient to locate material utilizing the current visual management systems within the factory.  We expect to significantly reduce the amount of time accounting and searching for material.  The cost is a fraction of what a commercial locating solution would be.
