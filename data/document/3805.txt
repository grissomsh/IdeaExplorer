GPS Tracking in office cabs 

am a regular user of EMC Transport and have seen this multiple times 
We have seen in lot of occasion that the transport department keeps calling the cab drivers to check the location and to assign next trips etc , the drivers are left with no choice than to speak on the call while driving , which could be a fatal when driving .if we have a GPS the transport team need not call the drivers all they have to do is track the cab and send out messages to the drivers as per there location 
this is would be a onetime investment but would save a lot on calls and management of transport schedule .
