Federation Partnership

Idea generated during a Womenâ€™s Leadership Forum  (WLF) Cork Chapter IGS in <site name(s)>. As the WLF  membership in Cork is very cross functional, we got  together as a group to see how we could bring that  variety of perspective to the challenges and had some  fun in the process.
Leverage a combination of tools and techniques to help functions with the federation connect, so they can understand how they operate to avoid re-inventing the wheel or learn from past experiences; Tools and Techniques will be a combination of 
Soft: encourage the senior leadership to establish the connections / contacts and partner with their shared functions within the Federation companies
Hard: 
Leveraging Inside EMC
Adding a checkpoint on connectivity within the Federation processes as they go through requesting changes to systems or adding headcount etc 
QBR style meetings on processes and opportunities
