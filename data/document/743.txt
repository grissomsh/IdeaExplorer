Sync BT, EAS, Apex & Shift Planning together
Time waste Reduction
too many apps to fill everyday to be compliant which is time consuming & a big hassle to fill and/or track
we can create an app that 
1. automatically extracts necessary reports from BT
2. extract the number of SRs logged on EAS (SRs/hour, rather than calls/hour)to accurately measure the occupancy of CST
3. import odd hours to Apex from the BT login log out Reports rather than manual entry
4. compare shifts starts with the login logout report extracted from BT that measures adherence & compliance
NO MORE:
*EAS incompliance reports 
*"Forgot to submit my annual, sick or swap shift"
*"Forgot to request the P/H as double pay or compensation"
*"I didn't get the pay for my odd hours work!"
