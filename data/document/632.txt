Hot water cooling for data storage appliances
Hot water cooling can significantly reduce power consumption for datacenters cooling with EMC datastorages. Exact impact have to be calculating via computer modelling and prototyping for different storage appliances and use cases. It can be adopted for wide range of appliances primarily of rack format.
As I have some experience with HPC development this idea is quite obvious because there are some production supercomputers used hot/warm water colling to reduce power consumption for machines (calculation not storage nodes because second ones can be external solutions) cooling.
It is basically usual water cooling system (naturally with some modifications on datacenter level) where water temperature is between external environment temperature (~20C for instance) and temperature of hot parts of entire computer system components (for 80-90C for CPU, 40-50C for HDD, 40-70C for RAM). For such water temperature there is ability to create free environment cooling system (without additional water cooling).  

This is research activity. Base on operation and deployment statistics we can choose portfolio of appliances which can be appropriate to reduce power consuption costs on cooling on first step. After computer modelling, prototyping and tests there will be milestone to make decision whether it is appropriate to develop such production option for each given appliance or not. Exact cooling schema is result of mechanical and thermal engineering for each of appliance.
As result we will have options for our customer to buy some kinds of appliances with water colling systems and hot water cooling systems. These systems help customer reduce operation costs for datacenter cooling in cases they will want to build (or just have) water cooling datacenters. Our products will be more ecological. Also, water cooling systems let to built more effective cooling which lead to system operation stability.
