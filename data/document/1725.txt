File Archival Solution - Combine CTA and DX
Currently we have two products which primarily does archiving (Storage tiering)
CTA - Cloud Tiering Appliance which could use policy based archival to Cloud / Traditional storage from NAS (VNX/Netapp)
DX - DiskXtender for Windows which could archive data from Windows hosts to low cost secondary storage
I have received many questions from customer and also internal teams related to both the products CTA and DX which made me realize about this possibility.
Create a solution which has the features of DX ad CTA so that customers can archive files from NAS and also Windows host to a variety of secondary storages like VNX, Netapp, Isilon, Centera, Atmos, DataDomain, Amazon S3 Tape Libraries, Optical Media etc..

With combining the features of DX also, it can address the block storage archival (to an extent) as the Extended drive in DX can be a LUN on SAN storage.
A good archival solution for the customer and expand the capabilities of the Cloud Tiering appliance which growing popular in demand.
