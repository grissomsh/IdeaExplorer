New Wave Training 
Contribute to an improved and more efficient Work Place 2.0.
Build a workplace for the future with more streamlined and relevant training. 
Up-skill our existing talent with focused relevant training.

The idea was a product of a group innovation workshop incorporating employees across various teams within CS. 
The program was facilitated by co-ops.
The idea was discussed and refined through group discussion.
Our solution would streamline training for each department and make much of the training optional.  
This could be tailored by role or by group so that if a particular training was required by one group then it would only be compulsory for them. 
All the training could be kept available for those who seek it so that they can consume it at their own time. 
The training could be made self-paced, more attractive and interactive than the usual string full of slides. CBT's could be improved by introducing more pictures and videos, animation, quiz-games, etc. 
As the employee would no longer be inundated with compulsory training modules the employee could dedicate more time and resources to relevant training material, upskilling in the most important area. 
The employee would have an improved knowledge of the product they are working on daily.
