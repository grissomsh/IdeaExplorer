Cross-BU support/sustain team
- Global Product Operations Challenge.
This innovation helps advancing the performance of our supporting processes and contributes to sustainability and customer TCE.
- CTD Supportability in 12 Months or Less
This idea improve the supportability of solutions that deploy multiple CTD products
- Ireland COE Challenge
We improve communication across our multiple EMC and Federation sites and also deliver enhanced collaboration across EMC’s Federation partners.
Thought about it two weeks ago, while reading the innovation challenges.
We suggest creating a cross-BU support / sustain team.
Instead of having a dedicated personnel on the support / sustain team, create a team which will be comprised of engineers from different BUs, where each engineer will be assigned to the team for specific amount of time, e.g. 6 months.
- Engineers know their product. Meaning 0 learning time.
- Engineers, if needed, can get help from within their BU, by just picking up the phone.
- It would be very beneficial for the engineers themselves, to see a real world’s use cases, and “feel” the customers.
- Engineers will learn about other products
- Engineers will make new, cross EMC connections.
-  Improves communication across multiple EMC and Federation sites and also deliver enhanced collaboration across EMC’s Federation partners.
