Tech chat room
Simple and Effective Collaboration and Knowledge Sharing
Issues faced while working on specific corner cases of certain EMC products which is not in scope of any documentation and can be solved only with prior experience.
The solution to address this problem is a Technical Chat Room. Very similar to IRC (Internet Relay Chat) client. Specific EMC products will have a specific chat room with Devs/QA/Support Engg, etc online 24x7 across timezones. For eg product specific separate chat rooms for Avamar/Networker/vMax/DD..,etc. So that in a short and given time an issue faced by an engineer can be raised to a wider audience at real time and responded by almost all people working on a specific time across globe at any point of time.
This will help the productivity and end to end knowledge for any EMC product.
 - This online chat forums can bring in more technical advancements in a product by gathering knowledge and discussions of varied technicians. For eg. a dev can get more understanding of product usage from a support engg or a qa by more frequent discussions on issues faced by them.
 - Efficient work around's from different technicians with a varied experience also resulting enhancement in a product.

Solution is a easy installation as it would be a simple IRC client which can be installed in any desktop also can be a mobile app. Chats can be saved into outlook also.
