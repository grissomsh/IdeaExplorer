Big Data and Analytic Tiger Team - https://inside.emc.com/ideas/3343
Identifying key manual processes, critical data sets, single points of failures, and non-scaleable implementations through-out EMC and providing a business value use case implementation that addresses these issues.
This idea stems from working with cross functional teams around EMC Data Science and Analytic events understanding how teams are accomplishing their goals.  Use of Excel, Access, manual email notifications, single employees that are the sole person that understands the process are in every organization.  
With the development of tools and attention around Big Data and Analytics, an environment exists to develop solutions that can affect the bottom line.  Utilizing Tableau, Alteryx, Collibra, and the BDL, we can offer a solution for improving EMC infrastructure.  The idea is to provide a Tiger Team with business process, data blending, visualization, governance and database skills to identify key business processes and automate them.  This tiger team can help teams with solutions while identifying key data sets to be added to the BDL and documenting the processes, business requirements and stakeholders ensuring business continuity and improving end to end processes.  This solution has the complete process of technology, process, and skills and is not focused on a specific silo of data which makes this idea different that what EMC internal groups are currently doing.
Success is taking existing resources within EMC to work cross functionally eliminating non-scalable solutions around Excel, Access, Work, etc and be able to provide documented key business solutions.
