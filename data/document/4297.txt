Thinking room

I was to busy focusing on my daily job I could barely set some time aside for innovation ideas. Additionally, the general mood/setting is not very encouraging for innovation which is why i thought that such a room would be beneficial.
Having a room specially dedicated room for innovative thinking. The design of the room would be very crucial fore setting the mood of whoever is inside. I'm talking colorful walls, equipping the room with all sorts of bulletin boards, whiteboards, notepads, colorful pens/markers, bean bags, light music...etc. Employess should be afforded a certain amount of time per week to use-innovate in this room. This should encourage more employees to participate in innovative thinking, not to mention this would be a big plus for the "Great place to work" concept.
