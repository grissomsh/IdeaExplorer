Working from Home model
the idea is about giving employees 2 working from home days per week that they will work 10 hours in these WFH days instead of working 8 hours in the office
WFH is a good option especially in work load time that it's better to work from home rather than going to the office and be bothered by traffic
My solution will increase employees' productivity and satisfaction
the idea will be implemented on all teams that can do their ork from home not necessarily from the officeÂ
