Disk Image import and export application
This idea is to enable faster and more secure product development through expanded, more efficient, and higher quality Engineering Shared Services. 
In Elab,the storage arrays changed a lot. I have to reinstall the OS every time to verify "Boot from SAN" after the array rotated. Then I think there should be application which could read the whole image of the external lun and write it into a image file. and we could reuse it on the new external array.
I would like to develop a software, it could read the whole external lun image to a file. I the external storage is removed or reinstalled, we could import the image file into the new luns. There is no other similar solution.
It improve the work effeciency. It would be a software on OS.
