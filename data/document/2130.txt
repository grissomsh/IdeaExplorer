VDI Converged Product
The Virtual desktop infrastructure is a solution requires a fast tier of storage and with the XtremIO deploying a VDI solution is faster and more efficient.
From previous experience the VDI solutions requires having a fast tier of storage and implementing the Horizon view could be a difficult sometimes, so we need a way to make for the cutomers to deploy the VDI solutions faster and easier.
My idea is create a product that could integrate the XtemIO with the VMware horizon View to able to deploy a virtual desktop infrastructure solution that would be easier to implement and easily configured and can be deployed faster and integrate Greenplum to provide analytic to adjust deployment of virtual machine on demand, analyze utilization data to able to predict futuristic expansion and this product can be easily allocate more resources to it; it will be like a self aware VDI solution in a box.
If the idea is implemented, the customers will have a product that can deploy a VDI solution with just a few implementation steps that would increase the customers satisfaction and introduce a new integrated product to the market and improve a product that we already have and customized it for a specific use that has a demand.
