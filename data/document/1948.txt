While working on a Data Protection Advisor POC, customer informed that they are using ViPR-SRM for their storage and they are using Mobile Apps. for the same to perform storage provisioning, LUN assigning, Capacity increase etc. 

They wanted to know why EMC doesn't have Mobile Apps. for DPA.
Companies are offering their customers more ways to interact with their products by developing mobile applications that allow users a new way to interact with their product or service. This could be a mobile application that allows users to view similar data as they would on their website or even a product that directly connects to hardware/software and opens up easier ways to connect and control the same.
This will leverage & provide benifits to all our customers and their top management.
