SW/HW Alignment 
Reduce the time Taken to perform ASC SW/HW linking process  and error % 
Problem raised by Contracts Department: The quoted report has about 53M of unknown product associations. This means that the software/hardware may be expired or on T&M but the MCO are unsure and this needs investigation and cleanup as required

Implementing a logic on the Apex Tool that is connected to the back end of the install base, catalyst and SAP.
This tool will have SW as input and the output will be the HW that is linked to this SW.
After having this output will be added on the Install base in the machine ID field.
So after this the contract team will quote the SW matching the same orders of the Associated HW.
The idea is in the test phase and it has 3 phases of success and now we are in the final phase.

The benefit will be in the Revenue enablment that will be from this project.
we have a small study regarding Revenue Enablement from this project we have enabled $18,343,258, and their is a potential revenue of $263,248,176
