Global CST Licensing Escalation Project
This is a process improvement globally. 
Inconsistency & inefficiency 
Team members accept SRs first, then reply to escalation email where others do the opposite.  
Not replying to escalation email (end of business day/Oncall). 
In busy days, some escalations may end up not handled. 
Replying to emails & checking same escalations on SC. 
Outlook flooding with escalation emails; sometimes 3-4 emails for same SR. 
Rechecking non-replied to escalations.
Rarely, SRs maybe worked by 2 agents.  
Creating conflicts and inconsistency among team members. 

The goal is to automate the escalation process which will reduce the process cycle time and eliminate the number of escalation emails. 
Eliminate the escalation emails received by licensing team by 31st of May, 2015. 
Reduce the process cycle time from 27 minutes to 20 minutes per case by the 31st of May, 2015.
