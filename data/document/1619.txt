Using Motion sensor all over EMC’s floors
Cost reduction method for EMC
Working in EMC for a long time, staying late at the office, working in shifts and working on weekends made me realize how much money we spend on electricity on an hourly basis with absolutely no one benefiting from it.
We have motion sensors in meeting rooms but why not in the whole floor? 
We can add motion sensors on all light controllers in each floor. Light will be automatically switched off 30 min after no movement around it. Employees working will have feel no impact, 

Cost reduction for EMC, not only in Egypt’s COE but across the whole world as this idea can be applied everywhere. On the long run, the cost of those sensors will never be bigger than what we pay for unnecessary electricity since it’s a shift based company.
Not to mention that saving the electricity saves the environment too. 
The most important thing about this idea is that it will benefit EMC and save the environment without putting anyone in any discomfort. It would be impossible to say: Oh I wish they haven’t made this change.
