Consolidate all development tools in one tool.

I just work with all of these tools...
Deploy Microsoft Team Foundation Service (TFS) which can replace all development tools.

Team Foundation Service is:
•Source Control in the Cloud - both TFS native and Git are supported
•IDE integration - TFS integrates with Visual Studio, Eclipse and XCode
•Automatic builds in the cloud - build your source on check-in or on a set schedule
•Automate your tests - run your test suites automatically on build; run different suites for different build types
•Manage your work - store your backlog of User Stories and Tasks, view your tasks, associate them with code check in
•Track bugs - log bugs and track their fix progress
•Collaborate - work with others

As I know EMC and Microsoft are partners, so EMC might have discount.
