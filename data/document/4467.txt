Health-check coupons for Employees and their dependents annually.

Few months back when I took a blood test at health-check camp conducted in the premises, I felt all dependents in the family also should get this previlage. I don't expect organization to do it free of cost for entire family, but it would be great if attempts are made to talk to some diagnostics, have a tie-up with them and ask them if any discount can be provided for health-check up.  
1) Concession on health-checkup's can be given to employee and their dependents in selected diagnostic centers. This will help employees to get their family's health-check up also done annually.
