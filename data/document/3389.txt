EMC in 3rd platform

I came up with the idea during a training course that i attended on "Business Acumen" a few days back. We were discussing Business Models of EMC and it's competetitors and it struck me that we're nicely positioned for the future - 3rd platform customers - and for us to make the federation work we need to show that the federation actually works with more synergy and is not merely on paper.
I think our position and strategy are very correct and critical. We're greatly positioned by the Federation structure. What's to be seen is the execution and speed of execution.
