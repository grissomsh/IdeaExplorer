Innovation Measurement Criteria
My idea is about changing the whole process of assessing the winning country in the coming innovation roadmaps

The process will be as follows:

- When assessing the idea there will be a rating button that will be given to each idea (from 1 to 5 where 5 is the highest)

- the idea will have an origin based on the idea's owner country (India, Ireland, China,etc) this has nothing to do with the coauthors country

- deciding the winning country will be based on the average of these ratings (for example: if Country A has submitted 10 ideas and the total rating was 26 then the average is 26/10 = 2.6, while if Country B has submitted 15 ideas and the total rating was 30 then the average is 30/15 = 2 then Country A is the Winning Country)
I always thought that Innovation Roadmap competition is a big thing and it has to be mainly based on the quality and value of innovators ideas
This idea will help in many aspects:

First it will make the innovation roadmap a quality based competition, also it will help innovators get rated for their ideas and make them feel the value of their ideas

All ideas will get a feedback or at least a rating, so users will know how to improve and work on their ideas

Also this will make innovators do all their best in their ideas
This idea should increase the number of great ideas also will make the competition more fun, more collaboration and more creative

The aim of this competition is to get the best out of innovators ideas, so this should be based on the effort exerted in each idea
