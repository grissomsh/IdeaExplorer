Catch them Young... EMC already in connect with various colleges for Training and for various social events. But are we really catching the young generation familiar with EMC technology or products. Any advertisements you see it gets more popular when you connect with the young generation. What we EMC doing for it?
Lack of branding in India for EMC apart from those IT companies who are in similar technology,  who are our customers or partners. 
Organize events targeting Bangalore based schools and college, organize some IT events or computer days. Conduct some competition, identify the bright students, provide scholarship, invite the children or youth to EMC premises to show the glamour of IT. Creating an awareness in public about the offerings of EMC and seek ideas from public for new innovations, rewarding those innovations etc.. more connect and branding of EMC
