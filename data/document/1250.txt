ViPR Data Services for Lustre and GPFS w/ ScaleIO appliances
Marries ViPR to Lustre and GPFS and play up the ability of Scaleio/ViPR to help customers manage storage at “petabyte scale” for use cases like Distributed Computing.
Historically, EMC has never participated actively in the Distributed computing market because we had never offered a cost-effective VNX solution for High-speed Parallel file systems like Lustre and IBM GPFS. I have been trying to compete in the Oil & Gas HPC market for a long time and in the end we always had very low margin and a high price solution when compared with solutions with specific purpose like DDN, Xyratex, Cray and IBM. IBM is making a similar solution available for GPFS called GSS and IBM Spectrum.
Make available ViPR Data Services for Lustre and GPFS to allow ViPR create the block Service from Scaleio components for those Parallel File Systems using commodity hardware.
It will allow us penetrate in HPC market and help the large companies with simulation and high Performance Solutions needs leverage an end-to-end solution as Today they have to manage silos for those environments. It will help us make money and compete head to head in the historically low margim market for EMC and also allow us to leverage the VCE investment to deliver ScaleIO appliances based on white label servers or leverage the future releases of ECS. It will also allow us to easily integrate DSSD in those workflows
