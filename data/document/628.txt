Also, customers are interested in, whether web client for document indexing provided for indexing documents
Idea was born during Captiva specialization SE's bootcamp. 
The idea is to extend web client by adding rescan & index functionality. it may be one web application with all functions (scan rescan index), or 3 separated as it was before in old clients. It'll make customers happy and help us with sales.
Direct impact on sales. It will improve customer satisfaction.
