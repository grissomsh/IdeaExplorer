Mobile app for customers to monitor and manage their datacentres

This idea came to me while complete the BSC in cloud computing 
By having a mobile application that would allow customers monitor their datacentres issues could be resolved remotely before they become critical. Administrators can remotely monitor their datacentre with out having to carry a laptop with them.
