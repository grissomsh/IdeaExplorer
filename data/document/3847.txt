Use ViPR to move data to across arrays to save power

I went thought some basic elearning for ViPR and thought on how ViPR can be used to save power.
1. ViPR solution can be used to move unused LUNs or poorly used LUNs to arrays that support storage pools that have Green Drives enabled for power saving.
2. If a LUN has no read or write hits for a long duration (days) it should be moved to Green Drives (NL-SAS) to save power.
