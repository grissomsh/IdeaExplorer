Virtual Diverse Team across EMC for Innovation
This will create lot of opportunities for people to collaborate . 
I came up with this idea when searching about a problem statement. Many use cases could not be found because of less interaction with diverse set of people. 
When collaborated with different teams across geography and from people of different gender, new areas of problem statement were unearthed. 

Create Virtual Team across EMC consisting of diverse set of people.

Take a sample set of 100 people create virtual team of 5 people.
Make sure each person is part of two teams one a diverse team and other a homogeneous team.

Give a problem to teams and tell them to come up with use cases, design etc. Compare the result with diverse and non diverse teams.

Identify the performance of diverse and non diverse teams based on number of ideas, quality of idea, collaboration across email,meetings. 

Share each person's feedback about virtual team mates.What they learnt from other person etc. what use cases were fund because of them .



 
This will increase the quality ideas in Innovation. Ideas will be mature.
