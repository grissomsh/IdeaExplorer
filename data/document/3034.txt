preserve the LUNs' WWN when capture the array configuration in the VNX2
We were using the arrayconfig tool to restore the array configuration in the VNX2 after ICA. the LUNs were original exported to RP&VPLEX for using. unlucky the WWN were changed after the restoring so that VPLEX&RP can not recognize those luns.
we tried to use arrayconfig to restore the array but failed with followings issues.
LUNs' WWN changed.
Rule checking can not be disabled
Resources did not wipe out in case of failure
Restore the LUNs w/ original WWNs.
Add some options to skip some rule check during the restoring.
Rollback all the storage resources(LUNs & Pools) in case of restoring failure.
customer may leverage this tools to restore the data center more easily in case of restore.
