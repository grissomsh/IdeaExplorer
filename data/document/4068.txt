Stop using Plastic spoons

We always talk about GO GREEN but we still find that lots of plastic spoons are used in our own Cafeteria which needs to be stopped. We can start using Steel spoons which can be washed and re-used. I compared the number of plastic spoons used in Cafeteria and the steel spoons used with street chats vendor to save money and to contribute my bit to environment.
Plastic is very difficult to re-cycle and re-use. We use plastic spoons in Cafeteria to have Snacks every evening which will be thrown after 5 minutes of usage and the same piece of spoon take ages to be re-cycled. Steel spoon just needs a bit of water to be cleaned.
