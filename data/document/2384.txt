Mobile device integrated with ViPR
ViPR has a lot of advantages on integration with other applications and other devices, also ViPR has very good automation on devices management.This idea is to extend it's integration to mobile devices and remote control/manage for provision.
To satify third-platform, ViRP needs to integrate with mobile devices or provide related API.
This idea hopes to can manage such as LUNs assignment more easilly by mobile devices or remotely. It's able to be APP of mobile device, by this APP, we can send out our customized requirement to ViPR server, and send out the messages with our requests such as what's type lun, what size we need and so on. When ViPR controller receives this information, it will create the resource refer to user's messages and detailed information, then the task done, ViPR controller will send back confirmation to user, let user know what have been done by ViPR controller server.For exampe, we will require 300G LUNs for a windows host, we need to create a configuration file, in which have the parameters of lun size, lun name, lun protected policy(such as snapshot) and so on. When the background service receive this message, it will create related LUNs automately, once it's done, confirmation messages will send to user.
Its more easy and convenient to provide resources for end user, and provide a control path to manage storage remotely.
