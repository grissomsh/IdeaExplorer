How to make EMC No1 company ?
Global visibility & a brighter future for everyone.
I know this wouldnt be a new topic but as from Support Team i feel we EMC can do a lot better from its current state. We are not doing anything new to resolve this apart accepting new cases daily.

Why should customer raise cases only for concerns and not for new purchases, new products & have good interactions.
1. Stabilize all the products we already have (make it bug free), do not release any more products. Master of 1, jack of others.
2. Have dedicated resources for every Elite customer i.e. CS, MS, PS
3. Give more than what customer buys. example give 30 day trial versions of other products.
4. Regular Management & customer interactions / feedbacks.
5. Do what customer wants i.e. fix most of the customer issues, more customization features, ask what customer wants. Which means " Being customer oriented company ".
6. Start giving tips & tricks about the products to customers.
7. Plan the next release / patch based on what customer wants & not EMC Wants.
EMC will top the Fortune 500 companies list.
