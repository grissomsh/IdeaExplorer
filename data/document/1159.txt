Serial Number Assignment (SNA) Process - https://inside.emc.com/message/509859#509859
The serial number assignment process will address product integration issues such as SNMP PEN numbers that are currently not tracked across EMC.  This process is an end to end solution that includes integration with infrastructure tools and can be offered as a service.
This idea was generated from the CTO office out of necessity when the individual that was managing the existing process left EMC.  Since then, there has been a collaborative effort to develop a formal process, identify all key PEN and PSN numbers through out EMC, formalize the submissions process and have a true database structure.
The SNA process provides a form via ServiceNow (3rd platform solution EMC already has in-house) for requestors to fill out.  The process can be automated to email the person for assignment of the PSN number and send the information back to the requester.  This solution will provide the ability to track ticket numbers, auto update statuses, publish existing assigned numbers via mobile and web applications.
Success will be when we have an end to end published process that includes web based submission request and provide visibility to all PSN and PEN numbers.  Ensure engineering has the proper inter-operability and provide a baseline solution for additional Serial Number Assignments, such as IEEE OUIs, iSCSI addresses and any other potential assignments
