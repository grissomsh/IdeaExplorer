Diversity and Innovation at a Great Place to Work
Proposed Idea will help improve process efficacy by providing more transparency and collaboration in the overall process.
I have been involved in project, program and people management from past 8 years. At times when we encounter issues in recruiting right skills and attitude from open market, I managed to experiment above proposed solution to get a positive outcome successfully every time.
My proposal is to refine the existing hiring process much further by adopting the agile methodology. This is predominately used in software development life cycle. However, this process can be easily adopted in hiring process by following the basic principles.  Again, this process was used only 1% in 2001 by the IT community, current adoption rate for agile is anywhere between 60-80% in the industry.


1. Resource requests are raised for new hire.
2. Consolidate the requirements and publish using information radiators (on the wall or white board).
3. All involved team members gather daily for not more than 15 minutes to discuss the progress.
4. Team shares the progress and feedback in common forum for next steps.
5. Impediments are raised and taken offline for the discussions.
6. Step 3 through 5 is repeated till the desired objectives are achieved.

Great place to work with improved process maturity, transparency and much greater collaboration in the workplace.
