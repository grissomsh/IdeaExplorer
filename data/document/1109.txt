Self-service test system for interactive development mode
  1. currently Datadomain DEV team will introduce a interactive development mode
  2. this model require each checkin "Do No Harm" to other branches
  3. as checkin are so frequent, lots of test is needed
  4. we can provide a system that meets this kind of test to improve efficiency
  we do the same thing in BATS/PATS, this "Do No Harm" can be just a extensive usage
  By doing some enhancement.
  1. we composed a distributed test framework that can accept different test bed
    and run different test
  2. clean up test cases that is qualified to run automatically
  3. group test cases by test bed into suites and add them to test automatic system
  4. the system can dynamically detect new build to run all test suites, or
  5. users can submit request to system per needs
  Make "Do No Harm" test run more timely and effectively
  Reduce lots of human effort to test the same test set time and time again
