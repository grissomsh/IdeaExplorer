End-to-End Disk Drive Data Consolidation
Disk drives are fundamental to EMCâ€™s product roadmap; however, critical information is siloed within functional units.  We propose a collaborative enterprise wide lifecycle information system that; integrates data, provides reliability analytics and predi
The need for a data source representing the different views on disk drives came in different projects of the data science team with GS and TCE.
The particulars of this solutions were hatched with David Dionisio, a reliability expert from TCE, and Dr. Raphael Cohen and Shiri Gaber from the IT data science team.
A PoC limited to VNX data was built in the Data Science lab and showed promise for predicting disk drive failures in advance by combining the VNX SP-Collect informaiton with TCE Historical Install Base
Our proposal is a documented coalesced disk drive table capturing the best of breed disk drive data across the EMC enterprise.  While conceptually simple, implementation requires overcoming business logic and discrepancies between units: data validation rules, filtering, timing of data feed and source system.  These issues have never been resolved. With that said, we have already explored a VNX specific solution to connecting all the data from Manufacturing, Total Customer Experience, Global Services and Engineering.

Success is an integrated information platform utilized across multiple business units to report consistent metrics, develop common analytics and research disk drive behavior.  Operationally, it will provide a single source of truth for all things disk dri
