Use digital signature or email acknowledgement for trip sheet in transport rather than using thousands of paper trip sheet for routings. this will save cost and paper wastage on a daily basis. when a pickup / drop is done employee can do a digital signature or send an acknowledgement email to transport acknowledging the trip is completed. 
It will be indeed a success as saving trees & cutting down paper costs.
