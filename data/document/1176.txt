Build Connections
I think this idea is very relevant to the challenge as it looks building communication and improving knowledge for employees. Additionally it also covers workplace of the future as ideally all companies would have this system implemented into each persons contract with the business.
I came up with this idea when I started a new job and wanted to know what were the common mistakes that I could avoid. 
I would like to have a forum for current employees to develop knowledge of who did their job before them and additionally for employees to communication to other EMC partners employees that are in similar roles. This idea can be simply conducted by their manger contacted the previous employee and setting up meetings. 
I hope this idea would help employees learn from previous employees mistake. The best way to build this knowledge is by the current and old employee meeting and exchanges common problems. This help EMC minimize waste and helps employees sanctification in their job as they can limit errors.
