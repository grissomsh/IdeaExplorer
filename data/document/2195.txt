Timezone preference on SRs
Improving customer satisfaction.
Suggested this idea last year, but it never came to anything. A simple check box near preferred language preferences would be sufficient.
Allows customer to request what hours they would like their request dealt with, thereby irradicating any unnecessary turn over. It also reduces the amount of case owners which the customer has to deal with.
It would improve customer satisfaction in that they could control what times a case is worked - ie during their own working hours. This would avoid the frustration of constantly communicating with someone in a different time zone. It would also give the customer a local experience in terms of language and customs etc.
