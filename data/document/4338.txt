Give me a Bike ride 

Egypt's new president road a bicycle trying to promote the idea of riding a bicycle in egypt.
We will have 10 to 20 bicycles according to the number of employees in the COE where employees could use it around the block instead of taking thier car poluting the environment and getting stuck in traffic. 

The bicycles are available in the parking area for any employee to use and return so other employees get to benefit from this initiative.
