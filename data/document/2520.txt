Automation of Health Check and Performance Report Generation in VNX 
The idea is quite relevant as we being the implementers or storage provisioners face the performance issues very frequently and if the idea will be implenmented we will be able to deliver the storage provisioning services to our customers without the dela
This is for the first time I came up with this issue as well as the idea.
