Talents Sponsorship Competition among Universities
We will ensure that weâ€™re getting diversity of thinking and ideas as we continue to innovate and that will help achieving EMC goal : becoming a top 10 global diversity employer by 2017
Idea is applied across a lot of multinationals including Schlumberger 
We will simply make a " Talents Sponsorship Competition among Universities " .. We can sponsor champions among the the world IT universities.
We will make a talent pool , competition and sponsorship of young innovators
We will start a group of liaisons with universities on EMC service centers all over locations and start building relationships with universities. 

Thanks,
