NAS Automation & Life Cycle Manager (NALM)
1.New product
2.New business solution to the day to day infra management challenges of the global customers.
3.New business opportunity and revenue generation.
4.Increased TCE.
The idea was generated while analyzing the day to day challenges of NAS administrators in the context of discussing some of the challenges we faced in a recent large file storage migration project.

The idea has gone through internal evaluation. 
1.Develop an application/product that can  end-to-end manage the 
NAS provisioning and lifecycle.
2.Automate not only the provisioning  tasks but also the  complete       management cycle  using an unique interface irrespective of the different NAS vendors in an infra.
3.Enable end user capability to carve out the required file storage  without administrative intervention but with the supervision of administrator.
4.Optimize the management process by being able to track the  file  share ownership and utilization at the business level. 
5.Optimize the reporting process and have a unique reporting mechanism across the whole file storage infrastructure and automate CMDB updates.

Note: Please refer to the presentation available on this page for more details on the idea and how it works.
