Yes, you can DizIt (DIGitize IT)!: An App to crowd source cultural digitization project ideas from employees
We propose a mobile app (available for android and iOS) called DizIt for all employees, and an interface for admin to create, manage and analyze such ideas for crowdsourcing from EMC employees across the globe. 
- Mockups 
- Prototype to get a feel of proposed app
- Solution and Architecture
- App delivery and availability mechanism
- Inside EMC community integration 

Employees can join the Heritage Initiative projects and can contribute, pictures, files (video, audio etc), comment for any fellow colleagues contributions and enhance the knowledge base thus making crowd sourcing more effective . Not only that, there is feature where people can suggest new Heritage projects in their local communities. DizIt supports English and One local language by default and can support a number of languages. Prototype/Mock ups shows you English and French as an example.
While browsing the challenges, we found community challenges as an interesting one. We being part of applications workgroup, found this complementing our skill sets. So Started on the idea. We did multiple white boarding sessions, learned the prototyping tool and came up with multiple intermediate versions before proposing the final prototypes. 
DizIt is based on an open source platform which can be integrated with EMC products. DizIt provides an interactive way to participate and contribute to the digitation projects under Heritage Initiatives.
