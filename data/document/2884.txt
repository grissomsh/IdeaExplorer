Labsmith as small group machine Steward
- Hardware resource sharing is one hot topic for Lab operations
- This idea presents feasible solution to meet one specific needs: machine sharing in small group (<50 persons)

Many times I found myself and people around could not get hardware resource when they want to verify code changes, however at same time there are hardware resources sit idle. Sometimes, when I finally managed to get one it is broken! How frustrated?!
- Leverage Django web framework to build Web Pages to manage a small pool of machines
- Use Bootstrap by Twitter for web page rendering and use sqlite to manage data
- Tabbed views, each tab contains one category of machine or hardware resource
- One intelligent action button that shows login user only one possible action that could be taken at a moment to one machine: reserve, release, want
- Integrate PXE so whenever machine crashed you could bring it back with no hassle
- Poll and display machine status on the page in real

- make full use of scarce hardware resources, reduce hardware inventory
- make sure there are always people accountable for the status of hardware resources
