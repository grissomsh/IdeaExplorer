Its become smart world around the globe ,it can help us to minimize the transport chaos with location share access. 
we are daily facing issues when the cab drivers are near the landmark after that they are struggling a lot to exactly locate employee home due to the misguided / wrongly understand because of language issues . 
now with the help of Google maps and whatsapp  application we can make it easy .
