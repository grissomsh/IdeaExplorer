Create EMC Public Cloud by setting up large Data Centers near Mumbai, Chennai, Philippines and other regions to capture the market in Cloud in future in EMEA and APJK regions and increase EMC share viz existing competitors in the cloud.

I was thinking about our largest Competitor Amazon and how in future we can be the largest challenger and capture a sizable chunk in cloud computing market.
In the future, things are moving towards a huge market opportunity in Cloud services that requires huge infrastructure investment in Large Datacenters. Besides selling EMC Storage, we also build our large Datacenters. We build EMC's own Public cloud where we can offer our services to all businesses whether small/medium or large and also Governments in different countries in future. Unless we have our own large Datacenters and our own Public cloud, we cannot compete with our existing large Competitor in Cloud in future. Why Data Centers near Chennai and Mumbai? Because the Undersea cable touch India at Mumbai and Chennai. Setting up Datacenters in tier 2 or tier 3 cities near these points will have high speed bandwidth for the datacenters. Similarly other regions in APJK can be explored for setting up large Datacenters. We can make use of old Recycled/refurbished storage as well as new EMC storage for the Datacenters.
