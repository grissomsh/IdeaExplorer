Hobbies' Centers For Fund Raising 
This is help with the below two challenges and will enhance the diversity and inclusion within EMC. 
A lot of people have common interests but lack the will to work on them or share them. We have a lot of good, yet, wasted talents that can be utilized for a good cause. 
Create a hobbies' center that will be administered by EMC employees. Each hobby will simply be a small workshop and would create their events based on each hobby. 

As creative as it can get! Book club, travel agency, Art club, adventures club..etc.  

This can be used to fund raise for good causes.
Employees will have the time and ability to work on their hobbies, this indirectly affect their ability to work and be be effective employees.
Fund raising will be done for good causes.
Great working environment.
Networking and building relations.
