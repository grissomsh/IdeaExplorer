Leverage Metal As A Service solutions to minimize physical infrastructure management and testbed setup
Currently, the lab infrastructure management is becoming more and more complicated as private, partner owned and hybrid cloud infrastructure has been merged together with rapid rotation. How to manage, govern, audit and use them become big challenge for t
Lab management and hand-on testbed preparation often take too much effort to the Lab Administrators and end users. Both are keen to find suitable solutions to cope with these issues.
Leverage some central tools to assign, govern and audit the hardware elements use. All hardwareâ€™s profile and internal components information must be inhabited in databases, and all device and connection change must be recorded via a central portal. End user authentication is also deployed for monitoring and audit use. And Metal As A Service can also help to build testbed on OS installation, initial setup, with help of LAAS, auto zoning and LUN provisioning. All of this can definitely reduce the effort on manual and interoperability testing.
Reduce the management and OPEX costs for the administrators. And the end user also benefits by effective source checking and using.
