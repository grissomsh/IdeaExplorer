Training open day
Changing the culture of training within EMC.
We (Neil Burns, Eoin Hegarty and Colm O'Leary) brainstormed this idea as part of a training initiative we worked on with David Moore.
Training and development is of utmost importance in EMC, both to our day-to-day work and to the future business position of the company in an ever changing technical environment. As such we would like to recommend a ‘Training open day’ where employees can meet with experts from the training department (L&D) to discuss training paths which will help immediately and will prepare for future career prospects within and outside the company.
 
This would take the form of a personal training session (such as we might see in a Gym or health centre) to encourage and promote training and development.
 
This could be cantered on just one facility initially (for example Cork) and subdivided into working groups.

Increase uptake in training, improve skillset among employees and help EMC employees become more rounded professionals.
