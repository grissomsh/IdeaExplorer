EMC-rivia

Came up with the idea while watching the world cup football games, the concept of different countries facing each other in a healthy competition and the sight of the cowards from different cultures joking with each other after the match and exchanging laughs and words was very pleasing.
EMC is already spread across different countries across the world, so we don't we take advantage of that to bring us closer from one another and be a truly big family 
A quiz based competition between different teams across different EMC centres world wide.
Think something like TV game shows, different teams will face each other in a tournament based rounds. Team with most correct answers wins and advances.
Categories covered within the competition can include anything (history, entertainment, sports, maths, etc...)
Wining team would be presented with a suitable prize according to a budget and a bragging rights certificate/banner which would be hanged within the team premises till the next time the competition is held.
Most important aspect of this competition is that the team which would face each other be from different countries, MLS France vs MLS Germany team for example etc...
