Power Calc. new tool
it will make it easy on the Field SE and the Sales to provide the customer will all power and environment report 
there is exiting tool powercalc.emc.com but its not updated with the new EMC products and its not accurate. Also its not working on MAC laptops

my idea is to implement a new GUI tool with drop down menu which takes the input from the user and provides him with the option to generate a heat and power report that have all details needed by the customer

have this tool implemented and being used by wide range of the field SE and Account managers to provide there customer with all details on the spot.
