Introduce GHE OnRack to EMC data centers/Labs/MFG
Make more BUs in EMC to adopt GHE OnRack HW M&O solution
Enab more BUs to do as much as possible automation in data center/Labs/MFG to replace manual work
When I am working with people from VSPEX PLUS to learn how they use qualisystem,basically they need to deploy OS/APP to bare metal server and currently they setup an own PXE server to do OS installation  from scratch then FW update . Obviously this work can be done by GHE OnRack
In GHE HW Lab ,If we want to install OS ,we need to go to lab to insert a CD or USB to manual install OS and if we want to upgrade FW , we need to find another tools to help us , If there is HW failure ,we can't get notification until we spend much efforts to figure out

If we look at Durham COE data center challenge ,they also need "bare metal provisioning a physical host, and allowing remote control of the devices (power on/power off, remote console and etc)" , this is exactly what OnRack is doing 
Leverage GHE M&O solution (please see this introduction of GHE OnRack in EMC world 2015 http://virtualgeek.typepad.com/virtual_geek/2015/05/emc-world-day-3-onrack.html)  to manage all HWs in data center/Labs/MFGs ,for example in MFG, we can integrate OnRack to Cumulus environment 

1 Automatically deploy OS/hypervisor against bare metal server to replace manual work
2 Automatically update firmware for servers in Lab/data centers/MFG
3 Environmental Monitoring
4 Configure BIOS setting through REST API to replace manual work
5 Provide remotely power on/power off and virtual console to compute nodes
..
last one is OnRack is RESTful API based so it is very easy to integrated to your end to end automatic solution , for example , if you have a global material sharing system to share your material to people/team etc ,you can call OnRack RESTful API to get  material configuration,HW rev,FW reversion etc so people can easily to know whether the available material can meet their request 
For GHE, it will significantly increase OnRack install base
