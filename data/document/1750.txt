Acces to Shared-drive Back-Up Files and Folders
In an IT contemporary workplace, there should be flexibility to view archive / backed-up files and folders on shared drives. 
Earlier this year, someone accidentally deleted a file I had saved on a share drive. I needed the file and opened an IT ticket to recover it. The file was eventually recovered, but it took almost 2 weeks before the file was made available. 

Again, recently, someone in the department cut a shared file from a shared drive instead of copying it. Kieran was able to recover it, but it raised questions on ease of access to back-up files and folders.

When you are spending time working on documents, it can be very frustrating when the document or part of the document is lost. Particularly when multiple people are collaborating on a document, there is a higher risk of mistakes being made. 
Each employee should have easy access to read / copy files and folders from back-ups of the shared drives that they have access to. 
 - Instant access to previous versions of files / folders on shared drives
 - Easier/faster time to recover documents and folders
 - No IT ticket needed
 - Reduce frustration
