Treadmill office

I came up with the idea because I noticed that many employees suffer from neck and back problems due to sitting for long hours working on their computers. 
Treadmills are placed under offices and desks providing employees the chance to walk while doing their work improving their health and reducing the impact of sitting on the desk for long hours.
