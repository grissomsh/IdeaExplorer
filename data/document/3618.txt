EMC online Center

Reading about the community Involvement challenge and getting to benefit from the new generations and transferring benefit to them as well.
The idea is to have a website dedicated to students or undergrads. It teaches them through videos or articles or live demos stuff about engineering, science, math, technology, cloud computing, big data..etc. 

Students are our future biggest investments. We can have employees from within EMC update such articles or videos so they become engaged in the responsibility of teaching the new generations the core areas of focus for EMC.

EMC online center website can also involve having online tests by which we examine the level of learning achieved and when students pass the tests, they will be granted an internship offering in EMC for 6 months. This will allow students to get to know more about EMC businesses and they can become EMC new hires after graduation.
