Data Domain Pool Rotation

I believe this is a very good technique to deal with resource crunch and attrition situation keeping the engineers involved, engaged and motivated.
Movement of engineers from One pool to another after every year or 2.
This will keep them motivated and will develop skills to understand the product over all. Keep it as a program where engineers could enroll.
