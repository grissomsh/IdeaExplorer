CSAT Monitoring Portal 
The idea will enhances customer experience and satisfaction from The Services provided by EMC. 
The idea came up as there was noway to track the history of the performance of each employee and to track his point of weakness when a negative CSAT is received ,Using sentiment analysis from the comments the the customers provide in the CSAT managers cant identify the reason of the dissatisfaction and work on it. 
My solution is a tool that counts the CSATS the Each employee receive whether it was a negative or positive one , analyse each of them using data analytic tools and sentiment analysis then stimulate this on a graph to track the performance of each employee.

This tool can be used by the Managers and by the employee as well to track his performance. 
1.Improve Customer's satisfaction.
2.Increase the Revenue for EMC.
3.Track the performance of each employee.
