3rd Platform Super Converged Infrastructure

As part of the EMC Engineering Efficiency team, we are exposed to many sustainability technologies and ideas.  About 5 years ago I realized that a data center is really just a pile of hardware with SW on top of it- and ther's a constant tech refresh every 4-5 years....  then "software defined X" came along, and we worked on the Kashmir OpenStack project.  We've also done a significant amount of lab work.  Putting all this together it was obvious there is a much better way to build large data centers. 
Completely eliminate individual chassis', power supplies, fans, and cables.  The rack is the chassis.  Compute, and possibly storage, nodes (PCBs) slide into the "chassis" just like disks slide into a disk shelf.  They plug directly into connectors at the back of the rack (power and data- probably 10Gb Ethernet).  An integrated top of rack switch/controller provides automated node initialization and configuration and "plugs" it into the cloud (whcih could be VMware ESX or OpenStack).  A rack could have a VMAX or VNX built into it as well.  The rack plugs into the data center with just four cables; 2 for DC distribution power, and two data cables (probably 40Gb for data).  The rack also provides EMI shielding and has an integrated cooling; a heat exchanger at the top and plenums front and back.  The exchanger pipes to chillers. Very efficient.
