EMC Blast Radius: an EMC 3rd platform Sales Enablement Analyzer

The idea came to me while thinking about 3rd platform Sales enablement tools
EMC Blast Radius is a sales enablement tool that analyzes our 3rd platform sales in the world.
The tool is connected to our Sales and Contracts’ systems to grab the information of our sales worldwide for each product.
The new tool will analyze this sales data to come up with technology gaps for potential customers. It will generate a report for our sales team with customers who did not purchase 3rd platform technologies (e.g. ViPR) and have a buying potential (this can be known through opportunities data from our sales system).
This Big Data tool will analyze and predict the potential 3rd platform sales based on millions of products sold to our customers around the world.
This tool will help increase EMC’s revenue streams through upselling our 3rd platform technologies to the correct target customers.
Reports can be generated from the EMC Blast Radius enablement tool by geography, territory or product.
