Use LAB AS SERVICE

From EMC SAAS where we have our customer's production instances.
In customer support scenario, we need to reproduce problems in different kinds of environment. If we can use our world class COE Labs as a service, it will be really good. 

The engineer would require to put a request for a VM(With the s/w, OS and harddisk, CPU specification). Once the request is put. The LAB team will create the virtual environment within a fixed SLO.

This will enable the engineer to reproduce issue in less amount of time and effort 

It can also be helpful for training purpose and the virtualized environments can be reutilized in different trainings.

This LAB as Service would work like SAAS.
