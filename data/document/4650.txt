Simplify EMC applications deployment through containers

Discussing with colleague's and from brainstorming sessions.
Docker automates the deployment of applications in the form of lightweight, portable, self-sufficient containers that can run in a variety of environments. It means that if we build a software application, we can immediately move it onto a cloud service or run it on other hosts without making any changes. Docker's container-based model (PaaS) is very flexible and is supported by major cloud providers like Amazon ( AWS ) , Google ( App Engine ) , Microsoft Azure , Rackspace Cloud etc . Containers help is streamlining the movement of the application to the cloud.

Docker can also be integrated into various infrastructure tools including open-stack. In the future, containers are expected to be nested. A software component that makes up a layer in one container might be called by another in a remote location. An update to the same layer might be passed on to any other containers that use the same component.

Our plan is to bundle Solutions Enabler along with Unisphere GUI ( and any other dependent applications ) , togather with all of their runtime dependencies and inside a docker container which can then be deployed on any of the major cloud infrastructures or on any host machine. This provides a clean way to deploy without interfering with dependencies of any other applications. Its easy for the users , since they just have to download the container and run it .
