Browser Extension for EMC Syncplicity

I was analyzing the existing extensions application of Chrome and Firefox browsers. But I couldn’t find a single extension app from EMC. 

    Actually there are extensions to store files directly from the webpage into Google drive/Drop box. Why can’t we also create extensions for our EMC Syncplicity?
A EMC syncplicity icon will be created in the browser. We can store the file directly by simplt clicking the icon.
