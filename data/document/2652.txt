EMC Information Experience Hub
In the Engineering Operations Services & Solutions (EOS2) Challenge, part of the ask is to measurably improve Customer Experience. In the Ireland COE Challenge, part of the ask is to improve comms across EMC and Federation sites, & the COE ecosystem.

When a customer visits an EMC site, we have a huge opportunity to impress on them the power of EMC and what its products, services, staff, and solutions can do for their business. We also have a huge opportunity to showcase EMC's brand, family of products, and the Federation. Some questions to ask: What's the EMC experience that customers leave with? Did they find the information they needed, and more importantly, did they discover information they didn't even know that they needed, or that EMC could offer? Afterwards, did they talk to their customers and colleagues about their EMC "information experience" - if not, why not? 
The EMC Information Experience Hub is intended to showcase EMC products, services, solutions, staff, and Federation in a more dynamic, intuitive, and interactive way. What makes it unique is that it's an "experience" that the visitor steps up to, or into. Through the use of QR codes, visitors can access content or "experiences" and EMC can push updates to them long after they have left the building. 
A standalone podium or booth, the EMC Information Experience Hub contains an integrated iPad or touch screen that allows users to swipe to the EMC product, solution, or Federation they are interested in. More details are available in the doc on Inside EMC
