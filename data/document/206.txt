IT Automatic Assist Engine for IT for faster resolution and cost saving
 The idea suggests a solution for IT help desk to achieve cost & time saving as well as faster incident resolution

 The idea came up from daily life experience with IT help desk + machine learning knowledge 
 
We suggest equipping the IT helpdesk backend with a recommender engine that runs analysis on structured and unstructured data (text) to automate incident resolution by doing the following 
1-	Take input data 
2-	Run the engine that will perform text analytics over the problem description and relate it to the best solution
3-	The system returns back the suggested solution and the relevant KB links..etc
4-	If any further assistance is needed a 2nd support line (human factor) is available to help
5-	The engine front end will be integrated to the IT chat and will analyze and recommend solutions in real-time. 

1-	 Save time and money
2-	Faster problem resolution
