Review EMC shelf life process for components at contract manufacturer
The conflict between EMC shelf life process and the semiconductor industry trend cause unnecessary delays and costs in supply. GPO is looking for ideas that make GPO/EMCâ€™s supply chain and manufacturing operations more efficient and effective.
In the past years we have received more and more reports from all the CMs that some of the semiconductor suppliers do not agree with EMC's current shelf life process. I extracted a list of the semiconductor suppliers that have most approved parts on EMC AML and reviewed their shelf life policy. Some suppliers like TI provided decent evaluation report of the component shelf life analysis. Today's industry technology is much improved since decade ago and the military now prohibits date code restrictions on component orders. It's the time for EMC to adapt to industry trend. 
To extend the component shelf life acceptance at CMs' incoming inspection to 2 years for all type devices and add specific waivers for those leading suppliers who are willing to guarantee a longer shelf life (e.g TI's extended 5 years shelf life). This considers both industry trend and EMC's will to protect against oxidation over time.  
Increase the assurance of supply, reduce the solderability test cost charged to EMC, eliminate the argument among EMC, EMC's CM and the component suppliers, ultimately reduce the volume of devices to recycling sites.
