Internal Social Network for the Employees better communication
Being in technology and employees are using social network for better communication and fast and good approach to get the things done and to access any information or data


Let's say I want to move to a 1BHK and to get this in cities now a days with out brokers are not a piece of cake with ice; you need to search and check for this to and fro from one real estate broker to another and need to pay one month rent as commission which I faced while I came to the city.

If there could be INTERNAL social site or communication for customer support or the EMC group just like FACEBOOK page where we can publish, sell, buy and adv so internally employees can benefit and also can have better communication. This will surely benefit the employees and also helps for more peer- to peer communication
It would be benefit to the company who made an interactive communication among peer- to- peer for the first time in IT storage industry
