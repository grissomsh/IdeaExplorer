Question of the Day -  D & I

Idea came from the news letter publishing in MS
Create and publish a daily question, via email related to
various cultures and customs. We can offer a small prize  to the individual who first answers the question correctly. Encourage  employees to submit ""stumper"" questions from their own culture
