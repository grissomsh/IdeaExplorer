Save Electric energy, Save money & help community

I see that many monitors will be in ON state which will never be used. Many engineers just lock the screen and go off shift or on break. Implementing the above idea will help to contribute to many other people in community. 
Update on TV screens across all the floors to turn off the Monitors and Desktops when not used. Use attractive e-mails once in a week as reminder (on Friday noon) to create awareness.
