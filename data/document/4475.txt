Productivity in 3rd Platform

Most of folks are online always and not necessarily using a required device/particular OS. Difficulty in attending meetings from mobile, separate audio dialing are few drivers to think in this line. 
Meeting productivity will be drastically improved if the following problems are solved:
1. Separate Audio dialing and Live meeting should not be there
2. Signing to a meeting should be extremely simple and not have to key in numbers and audio authenticate.
3. Participants should be visible on the screen by default
4. Voice to text conversion with reasonable accuracy should be captured, which will avoid later typing minutes of meeting.
Chat:
1. Instantaneous Voice Chat should be possible with any other colleague with touch of a button, from communicator like menu
Mail:
2. While viewing an email, should be able to instantly request a video conference with all parties in email if active
