 “Daily/Weekly Brief” – keeps EMC CS oriented and focused  

 The idea came up from a real example. It is implemented locally in one department and it raises awareness gradually.


 The idea is simple. A team gathering will happen for 5 to 10 minutes daily/weekly in which the team manager will :

-	Give a brief on where the team stands and its status 
-	KPIs brief
-	A message of the day/ lessons learned from yesterday
-	A mission of the day

This will help to :

-	Increase employees awareness of their mission and performance
-	Solve issues before they evolve
-	Maintain better KPIs
