Customer buying the pre-paid hours for support

During one of the contract issue where customer was not entitled for support but we supported him bu mistake, he went ahead and bought the contract.
Small customers who generally dont buy support contracts from EMC can be given those pre paid hours as trial/sell. EMC will be in better position to sell support contracts to these customers in future.
