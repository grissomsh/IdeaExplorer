Automate system for the office boys

When the office boys took the computer course I felt that this will make it easier for them and for us instead of missing the calls and leaving the phone ringing wiht no answer. 
Adding a screen in the kitchen where whenever any employee needs something, he/she could send a request and this request would appear in the screen in the kitchen for the office boy. So if he wasn’t in the kitchen at the time the request was made, he’d still know what I need when he comes back.
