EMC Sporting Club

I attended a Tuesday match to support my colleagues. It took me too long to get to the club they play in. So I thought of this idea as a facilitation to EMC employees.
EMC always encourage its employees to participate in sporting activities like football, squach, bike riding,...etc.

The idea is to have EMC sporting club; a place or small club rented by EMC where employees will have the luxury of doing the sports they like. Instead of the far away club where people play football every Tuesday, we can have a nearby club only for EMC fun activities. It can be open all days of the week; each day is for a kind of sport.

This will increase communication between emplyees. It will allow them to exercise the sport they love and they will feel EMC is not only a place for work, but also for fun. Mixing work with fun is a great thing to make EMC a great place to work.
