Personal Cars Advertisement

I got the idea from seeing buses and trains that have ads on them.
Simply EMC will print some posters and stickers that will look very nice and with good quality and can be put on cars. The employee who accepts to take these posters and stickers and put them on his own car for a certain period of time will get a reasonable amount of money. Hereby the company will reduce the cost of paying a lot of money to advertisement agencies and at the same time increase employee satisfaction.
