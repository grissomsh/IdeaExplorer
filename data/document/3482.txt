 Multilingual ViPR ! – is a ViPR that speaks traditional storage and cloud !
ViPR-OpenStack Integration - towards scalable on-demand application-aware storage by EMC


 The idea came up while preparing a ViPR awareness presentation with one of my colleagues. I started to think of the concept of abstraction and aggregation over heterogeneous storage sources and vendors
 

 The idea works as follows: 

-	Equip next Generation ViPR with an enabler/Plugin that allows it to communicate with and provision storage from Cloud Storage Services.
-	Use aggregation and abstraction to allow the user to provision storage with few clicks
-	This feature can be a separate license the customer can buy and install.
-	Allow ViPR to manage and move data between “Tiers” between the physical storage and the cloud
-	Allow a unified management interface for the whole environment through ViPR GUI interface
