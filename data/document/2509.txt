Everyonesells next step - mobile application for CS Field teams
It will improve TCE as we will be able to report in real time what customer has mentioned about EMC, EMC products, current concerns about technology and competitors.
This idea came ti my mind few days ago because I think we are losing important feedback from our customer. The CS Field team is like a sensor, we are close to customer when they have problems and in this situation Customers are very honest 
The idea is to improve the current WFM Servigistic Mobile App to help CEs to report this feedback in real time. We can classify the feedback in 4 categories: Clear Lead identified, Customer concerns about new technologies, Customer feedback about competitors, Customer feedback about EMC. 
Promote the “Everyone Sells” culture with this easy step during the ticket reporting. Increase the value and visibility of the local CS Field Team
Increase TCE and Revenue. Reduce the focus and pressure on the KPIs related to ticket management.
