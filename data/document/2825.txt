Generating more relevant data with embedding Microprocessors in the fabric we wear.
This is a new idea which i got and not trying to copy or compete with any other idea.
I got this idea, when we got to know that the MRI,CT scan will give you data only when we are scanned and not the whole day/week's. Also, we cant be in diagnostic center whole day for getting accurate data.

Designing a fabric material which will help in absorbing the heat/movements of the human body and accumulating the data. Also, this energy will get de-staged to a centralized location with the help of seat/desk where we can generate other form of energy.
This idea can be used to evaluate a human body's MRI, CT and other scans along with we are getting an option of generating power to our daily consumables.
