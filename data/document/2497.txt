TCE Challenge
I am submitting this idea against TCE Challange on behalf of USD team .
I am from USD team and as we cover weekend shifts, during weekend shifts, customers perform the Disaster Recovery testing and they do not follow the correct procedure and sometime they end up with DU . Even though the do's and dont's can be found in the support site, few customer's follow and few don't. Hence, I thought, if we could provide them the recommendations or do's and dont's in the Unisphere . It could save time for both the customer and TSE and could improve customer satisfaction .
If we provide the recommendations or do's and dont's in the Unisphere like, when a customer points the mouse cursor on the switchover button in the Unisphere, it should pop up a dialogue box stating, when to do and how to do the switchover . Same with the other things like failover, reverse switchover and creating a CIFS/NFS  share or server . This will avoid the unnecessary DU and also will reduce some of the SRs . I feel this could be one of the point for the TCE .
If the idea is fully incubated/implemented, it would b just a add on feature in the Unisphere client. The benefit to the company is like it could improve the Total Customer Experience and customer satisfaction .
