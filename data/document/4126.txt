Bring together IBM's Watson and EMC's Atmos to target the healthcare vertical

A few years ago, I had come across the Jeopardy challenge where IBM's Watson competed against the show's all time winners and defeated them. I have been been following its evolution intermittently since then and watched its foray into the healthcare industry and its ongoing work in finance, public sector, research institutes and other such verticals. While its compute and processing is ground breaking, combining its natural language processing ability with the size, HA, scale and easy manageability of data that EMC's storage could offer struck me as an idea to tackle the big data challenge that the healthcare industry faces today.
The idea is to bring the tremendous compute of IBM's Watson together with the 'Big Data' that it feeds off that would be provided by EMC's Atmos.

What IBM Watson offers healthcare:
- Combine knowledge from medical journals, physician inputted symptoms, patient records, doctor's notes etc. to develop a hypothesis and provide potential treatment options along with its confidence ratings. [1,2]
- Poised to achieve "The fourth and highest tier of need, known as discovery, is where the analytics peruse a vast body of papers and other subject matter expert inputs related to research on the condition being studied."[3]
- Navigate and process EMRs to unlock hidden insights within the data, with the goal of helping physicians make more informed and accurate decisions about patient care. The massive amount of health data within EMRs alone presents tremendous value in transforming clinical decision making, but can also be difficult to absorb. Watsonâ€™s natural language processing capabilities allows it to process an EMR with a deep semantic understanding of the content and can help medical practitioners quickly and efficiently sift through the massive amounts of complex and disparate data and better make sense of it all. [4]
- Some of the sources that Watson uses today for its knowledge base are medical journals such as Nature and British Medical Journal [5]
- "Watson has bigger ambitions than a clinician's assistant, however. Its medical knowledge is around that of a first year medical student, according to IBM, and the company hopes to have Watson pass the general medical licensing board exams in the not too distant future."[5]

What EMC Atmos offers:
- Scale out object storage platform purpose built to store, archive and access unstructured data and support unlimited applications and services at cloud scale. [6]
- Active/Active architecture (multi-site A/A too), muli-tenancy, seamless scalability, HA, replication to name a few [6]
- Support for access from different types of devices (web, mobile, traditional applications) [6]
- SaaS to enter the public/private/hybrid cloud segments [6]
- Ability to be used in conjunction with EMC ViPR that allows tremendous opportunity for expansion, data migration, flexibility, manageability and lower TCO
- The virtualized edition of Atmos offers a lower cost solution that could possibly be used to position against IBM SONAS

What bringing these two technologies could offer together:
- Companies that use various sensors, biometric devices, etc. (connected health systems) to generate patient data have mushroomed. [7]. In addition to this, there is traditional patient data generated by individual hospitals, medical journals, books, research papers, analytics etc. that contribute to the majority of the healthcare data. What is common here is the diversity of data, their magnitude, and their unstructured nature.
- The ability of EMC Atmos to effectively store and quickly retrieve this data along with its multitude of other features and the ability of Watson to process large amounts of this unstructured data would complement each other well to address the big data problem in healthcare (Watson is currently better at processing unstructured rather than structured data [5])
- By targeting select sectors- specifically, hospitals, medical research institutes, connected health systems that generate such data, EMC Atmos could be marketed to manage their big data problem. Its low cost, scaleability and various other features listed in the earlier paragraph could enable positioning it against IBM's SONAS [8] which is currently used in conjunction with IBM Watson.
- In a tie up with individual healthcare providers/government and IBM, we could ideally combine these information silos to generate EMRs and EHRs which would be the cornerstone for Watson to perform its analytics. The more data that we could bring to it, the better its confidence rating for its outcomes
- Re-using the data generated by Watson and storing it for further analytics 
- Combining EMC's ViPR along with Atmos and Watson could have far reaching benefits in terms of seamless migration (e.g., if there was a need to move from say unstructured data to structured), low TCO, easy manageability.

Potential challenges the idea could face:
- Positioning EMC Atmos against IBM SONAS
- Costs associated with pushing for EMC ViPR along with Atmos for SMEs.
