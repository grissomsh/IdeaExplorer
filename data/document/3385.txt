 Eye tracking + Big Data analytics = Unique User Interface experience

 The idea came in from the adaptive keyboard concept. I thought about something that is visual and serves the same target which is adaptation to user needs.
-	 Use eye-tracking softwares using the laptop camera to capture the userâ€™s eye patterns indicating information on what areas the users focuses on most of the time and what areas are called blind areas. 
-	Collect the data for analysis by Data Analytics techniques and pattern recognition algorithms to know what is the best design that suits this specific user.
-	Adjust and customize the web/app design to fit the user needs. For example move the announcement panel from a blind area to another area that is more observed by the user.
