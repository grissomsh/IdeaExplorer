My Idea Application
NA
It took me personally a lot of time to get a project idea out and to the managers and get it approved. 
Have an easy and simple application that would get your idea and suggestion to your direct manager immediately. just write it up and hit submit. Managers can invite you to a meeting to discuss or skip. 

Mangers can post a specif challenge they are facing as well and ask team members to pitch in ideas on how to solve it. 
Very easy to use.
Write the idea and send it to my manager > very encouraging. 
Make use of innovation and create minds.
Managers can use it as well to post challenges. 
Can send a meeting invite through it and include more people.
