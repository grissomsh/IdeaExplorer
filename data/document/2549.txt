Bridge between IP/LAN & SAN World
NA
With EMC roadmap towards solution support we see a big disconnect between SAS team with rest of the team.Though the customer base is same but since we have different product line to handle the interaction with other teams are very limited. This idea can facilitate that & expand the scope of solution support.
Every customer environment has both SAN & LAN component where EMC majorly leads in coming up with SAN solution & support it is also has product line which takes care of IP/LAN part of. At present both are running in different streams & if we can come up with collaborative effort & find a solution to align both LAN & SAN world as one offering from EMC then not only it will be a big sales boost but also will help in scaling the solution support model where customer need not to worry about engaging two different teams & can get their issues addressed through single point of contact. This could be a CSAT impacting factor as well
