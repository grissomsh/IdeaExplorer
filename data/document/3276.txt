Photography Contest and Marketing

I love photography and I want it to be more recognized by the company.
Employees who are interested in photography send the best pictures of the month and then all the employees vote for the best picture. This picture will be hanged at the entrance of the company for a whole month. Then EMC could take this picture and use in marketing campaigns or on its websites or take it in others contests with other companies.
