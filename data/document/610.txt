Closed cooling with cold back door for rack data storage appliances
New cooling schemes are appropriate to reduce operation costs of datacenters. Usually for datastorages traditional hot/cool alleys are used because such systems are external to compute part of datacenters. But computational part of datacenters especially in supercomputing move torwards to more effective new cooling schemes. It can be reasenobla to implement such effective schemes for storage appliances too.
In one of my previous jobs our team studied such cooling scheme for racks with computation nodes. I think such approach should be investigated for data storage appliances-racks too for customers who can develop water cooling datacenters.
Solution is to develop germetize for air flow rack (currently available on the market) of standard size with special air directive plains to organize air flow in way where cold air setup from front of modules via usual cooling fans and hot air for back side is directed on cold back door which is water cooled. It will be circular air flow between cold back plane and front side. Carefull modelling will show for which kins of our rack products this cooling scheme is appropriate.
This will be an option for existence data storage appliances of rack format. Physically it will be set of additional air flow directive plains to mount into germetized rack and specail cold plate to mount as back door. customer will be able to by such modified rack and setup it into his datacenter with water cooling system (customer can create water cooling only for such racks not for other existed racks in datacenter). Such solution will reduce power consumtion for cooling.
