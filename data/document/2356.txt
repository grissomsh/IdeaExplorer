Demo page of unisphere
We know that customers are taking benefits from knowledge base and online discussion forums. This application will help them further as they can do it all themselves
I recently visited a mobile shop and he had a dummy mobile, have all the screens that an android has. Yes, it was not real
A web based page can be designed, similar to the unisphere. This can have all the tabs and links similar to Unisphere, yet no actual data in it.
Customer can get hands on experience using the unisphere and its related options without worry about meddling with his actual array
Customer's will become more comfortable using the options in unisphere and hence learning to the use EMC services better.
The idea can not only be implemented for Unisphere but for all other EMC applications
