Storage Arrays Liquid Cooling System.
By improving our hardware architecture, with implementing the liquid cooling system mechanism, it will help in manufacturing better hardware products (storage arrays) with a new form of heat reduction for a better thermal transfer of heat between components and the cooling system by using liquid coolants instead of using normal fans, which will help us to improve and sustain our hardware components' life cycle, besides using the liquid cooling system has a flexibility regarding the customer data center environment with different architectures, in addition to that it helps in moving to more efficient and sustainable operations.
I am a gamer and I love playing games and I was going to get a new pc desktop with a liquid cooling system as games need nowadays more high tech processors and this dissipates a lot of heat and temperature to the PC, besides this could really be a big problem when you are using your PC for a long time.
Liquid cooling system will solve a lot of issues, first it will cool all the hardware components of a storage array better than the air cooling mechanism, as the air cooling mechanism is very weak plus it requires a lot of fans which causes a lot of noise, besides using fans has a huge disadvantage of spreading the heat all over the cluster between the hardware parts and they may cost a lot failures to the hardware components which will cost a lot of money, so using the water cooling mechanism will first cool the parts better, and has less noise, and also saves a lot of costs, besides the liquid cooling system keeps the storage arrays running at its most efficient temperature no matter what the operating conditions are.
-when applying the liquid cooling system to our storage arrays, there will be no more use for the air cooling system which is represented in fans leading to less noise.
-The heat will go through the coolant not among the cluster, so this will significantly reduce the heat and temperature on all the hardware components of the cluster.
-Also we can reduce the temperature from specific parts of the components in the cluster more than other parts by cooling them by wider coolants or increasing the number of the coolants tubes than the other parts.
