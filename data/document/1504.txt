download matching Java version when collecting to Unisphere
decrease OPEX
the idea came up when i tried to log in unisphere but failed due to mismatch java version. and it is time consuming and difficult to search and install a match version.   
store java in unisphere. pc is able to download match java client when connecting to unisphere like ESXi vsphere.
it would be easier for user to log in unisphere. user experience is increased
