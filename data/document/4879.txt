Green Buildings Awareness Sessions “GBAS”

My idea is to have an environmental sustainability sessions for EMC employees to increase awareness of what EMC is doing as a company and what you can do as an individual.
Also we can deliver this sessions to EMC partners, university`s and schools.

At EMC, the long term business success depends on operating in a healthy environment. Each and every one of us has a crucial role to play in integrating environmental sustainability into our day-to-day operations. Only if we can transform the way we think, work and live will we be able to overcome the environmental challenges we are facing.
