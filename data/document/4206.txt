EMC Dress up day (Quarterly)

the never changing daily routine needs a change every once in a while to refresh everyone.
We would simply decide on a theme for one day per quarter when everyone would come dressed in accordance to that theme. So for example we could have a 70's theme, a superhero theme.....etc. This would most definitely raise the spirit amongst the team members but the daily work will not be affected at all.
