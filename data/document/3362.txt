Sensors for Light saving Everywhere

Sometimes I go to work on sunday, which is a day off and I find out that the bathrooms lights are always on. Also we have electricity problem currently in Egypt, so we need to help our country and save light.
We will equip the areas that have constant lights like bathrooms and kitches etc with sensor lights, so that they are only on when someone is using them. This will save light tremendously.
