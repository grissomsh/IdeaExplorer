We already had a winning prototype of STEM Brainteasers under Community Involvement Innovation Challenge 2014. We have created STEM Brainteasers for Students of Grade levels 9-12.

Going through Utah Challenge, we felt it would be great to leverage the winning STEM prototype with other requested features in the App.
