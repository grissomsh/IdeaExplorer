Vertical 1: Existing Customers

• Attribute Analysis: Drilling down to know the attributes which qualifies for Hybrid Cloud Setup.

• Share of Wallet Analysis (SOW) : Identifying the high value customer based on purchasing capacity & Workload.

• Recommendation Engine: Fetching the inventory of application (workload) types from the Customer site and the EMC Products hosting them, and then tying it back to the Fed Solution based on the key attributes derived through Basket/Bundle analysis.
