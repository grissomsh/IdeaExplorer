Incomplete details for DSR SAM details in the SR
some times not always we have an SR which has complete details of the DSR/SAM details in the SR also that some times the details mentioned are not updated.

We always have to find these details through dropping an email to few DL and sometimes we get a response and sometimes not. 
In few SR's we need ask customer to involve their AM/SAM to achieve their requirement but many times it happens that customer them selves dont have the details handy. 
We can have a direct link available in support so that we can easily reach to the DSR/SAM of the customer site
Benefit is that we won have to wander around every time to have these details it will be a very easy way to have these details as and when we want to
