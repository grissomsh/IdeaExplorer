ICOE Transport website improvement.
Improves the existing process thus increasing employee satisfaction, adding points to Great Places to Work.
Suggesting since long time, the only improvement was that transport started sending emails with drop routes for certain drop times however the emails are not regular and not for all drops.
ICOE transport website should publish the drop routes on the website itself. This will enable the employees to know their routes beforehand rather than depending upon the transport drop rosters in the basement area. Transport team anyways has that data available with them beforehand, why not share it with employees who need to know and use this data.
Employees will save time.
Less employees will miss drop cabs.
