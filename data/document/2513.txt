Universal ISIS Communication layer
Implementation of this idea will allow effectively using Captiva (part of ECD) products on Citrix and/or MS Terminal servers.

Captiva PixTools SDK will include "Universal ISIS Communication layer" so all scanning applications based on PixTools will be able to work on Citrix or MS Terminal servers. Currently scan application can work on Citrix server only with specific ISIS drivers which support this feature. Only limited number of ISIS drivers have Citrix option. To support it into other ISIS drivers ISIS team has to implement the feature for this driver, build driver and release. Obviously all these steps requires significant efforts which increase cost of such solution. Adding "Universal ISIS Communication layer" in PixTools product will add Citrix support to ALL ISIS drivers, even released several years ago. Currently scanner manufactures pay for Citrix feature in their ISIS driver so you might think that EMC can lose this money. But this is not so. Citrix feature can be licensed separately for every particular ISIS driver when scanner manufacture pays for the feature. Although this won't require rebuilding ISIS driver and sales team will just provide license to enable this option for particular ISIS driver.
If customer wants their scanner works on Citrix or MS Terminal server he just pay to EMC for additional license which enables Citrix support feature for this driver. No additional efforts are required.
