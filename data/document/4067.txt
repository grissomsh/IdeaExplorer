On demand Performance boost on VPLEX for 3rd Platform workloads

This idea came into being based on observations in customer issues where customers wanted performance to be better during cirtical time of business.
VPLEX can give a thrust to the performance of applications by intelligent cache management, front end multipathing and increased resources on back end. By requeting a boost for performance , cache is reserved for the data and data is prefetched from Storage array. Front end multipathing will intelligently shut down non-optimized paths and only use paths which give maximum performance. If there is sufficient advance planning , VPLEX can automatically move data to a high performance array as well. In a VPLEX Metro this can be improved by making sync volumes asynch as well as detahcing the leg. This performance boost is for a specific period.
