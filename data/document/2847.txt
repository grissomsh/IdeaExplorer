Card game to match EMC solutions to client demands 

• On-line card-games can improve communication across multiple EMC and Federation sites
• Using an extensible card game is a innovative way to build a workplace of the future
• Observing how players do play the game, and using experienced gamers to train
BRDC researchers used to play card games during lunch break. We realised that the card game format was suitable to increase our awareness of EMC's products and services in a way that is simultaneously educative and entertaining.  
The card game is composed of cards representing: a product (Isilon, VMAX, VSPEXBlue, etc), a service (Syncplicity,Documentum, etc), a client problem (automate a library, eliminate backup in tape, etc), constraints (cost, size, deadline, etc). The game is played trying to match solutions to problems, while respecting constraints.
It can be played in cooperative or competitive fashion.
It is ludic, integrative and educative.
Moreover, since it is a card game, it is naturally modular, where new cards can be issued any time to contemplate new products, services, constraints or rule sets.
Phase 0: templates of cards and rule book to be printed by any EMC branch
Phase 1: implement a on-line version of the card game to allow cross-branch games
Phase 2: if the game becomes popular, manufacture the card-game through the gaming industry to give
