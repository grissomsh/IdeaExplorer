Automation testing.
A tool to define the test environment and execute the test. We can use the UI to setup to test environment from available test pools such array,IO host, test execute client and so on. We just need to choose the test resource whatever we want and complete the network topology automatically(we can get the network info from swarm system) by using the UI of the tool, then choose the automated scripts and add it to this test env. Finally we just need to click the "run button" to execute the test cases.   
Improve test efficiency.
