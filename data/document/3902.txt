Automation to extract NetWorker resource database

The idea came into mind because of a customer requirement, whose requirement was to merge 3 NetWorker datazones to one.
We have already done merging for the customer using my script.
The idea address the problem by creating a script which can extract data from resource database and keeps in a text file which can be used on any OS platform.

These extracted txt files can be then used to re-build res database or merging two res databases.

I already have created a shell script for UNIX/Linux platform.
