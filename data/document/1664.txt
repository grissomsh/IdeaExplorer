EMC Training & Development
It is important to have at least some basic training in Microsoft Excel, Work, Outlook, Powerpoint, etc. for many of the roles in EMC. 
I recently tried to get a place on a Presentation Skills course only to find there were no available slots. This is a regular problem for certain courses.
Train volunteers to become trainers and hold classes regularly. It could be just Microsoft applications or it could also be classes such as Influencing Skils, Team Leader Essentials, Communication Skills, Project Management, etc.
Consider also having people give classes outside of working hours on non work related subjects such as languages, typing skills, etc.
Utilize the huge knowlege / skills base at EMC.
Improved availability of courses. Classes would be run when required. More people would be able to become proficient at the various skills taught. 
Training more EMC employees to become trainers would allow people to get experience at training. People may also appreciate the opportunity to get experience to train. EMC would have a larger pool of trainers. The range of classes could be expanded to include Presentation Skills, Clear Business and Email Writing, etc.
