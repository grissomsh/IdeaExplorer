Virtualized IoT management
This idea provides a holistic view for managing the devices in the smart city
New for this challenge
Provide cloud services for managing devices from different manufacturers.
Use this cloud service to provision, monitor and manage the devices the organization owns.
Create services for
* Provisioning devices
* Reporting monitoring metrics
* Audit logging

The cloud service is a virtual layer, a gateway, using the manufacturer APIs behind the scenes and providing an aggregated holistic view of the smart organization.

The fully implemented idea would be a cloud service operated by EMC.
EMC will use analytics to gain insights on the IoT market.
Enterprise customers will manage the IoT devices using the EMC cloud based management instead of through the manufacturer management UI.
Enterprise customers purchase a subscription directly from EMC and get complete visibility to the smart organization they operate.
