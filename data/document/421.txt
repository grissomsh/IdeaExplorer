Automating the Supportability of Data Protection Software
When the Data Protection Software fail for some reason, the customer is having great difficulty in finding the cause of the failure and troubleshooting the same.

There is generic error message displayed for multiple issue,  means same error code displayed for multiple issues.

Customer is having great issue in "User Experience" in using the product.
Many Customer escalation was due to configuration issue in the Data Protection software deployment and Customer lack in troubleshooting skill (due to complexity of the product). 
Every Product has different state in the workflows. 
For example, for backup work-flow, their could be a following state.
State-1. Initialization - say code 001
State-2. Snapshot creation - say code 002
State-3. Rollover start - say code 003
State-4. Delete all temp files --- say code 004
State-5. Backup complete - say code 005

When there is failure of Snapshot creation, this will end up with display code-002. The code 002 define the scope of problem and debugging requirement.

Based upon the error code, the software "automatically" should connect to the EMC support site and perform the following tasks:
1. Provide the list of "steps to try" to the customer that could possibly fix the issue.
2. If the auto response message doesn't solve the problem, then open the SR request automatically for further follow-up.
3. Automatic mail notification send to the relevant support staff.
4. If the problem is not solved within the expected time, automatically (through mail) escalate the issue to the next level.
5. Update the customer deployment to EMC support site, which is a resource for engineering for analyzing for feed-backup and quality improvement.
