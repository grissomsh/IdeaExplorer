SRM upgrade through GUI
This Idea would help in clearing all the SRM backlogs by reducing the time of upgarde.
When doing a SRM upgrade,We are facing this issue often,Especially when it is large environment the upgrade will go to hours which would be tedious and time consuming.
Trying to do the SRM upgrade through GUI,would solve this problem.Through GUI changing the path is just a click away.We need not type the path or command, everything can be done through a click which would need only half of the time we use while doing through CLI and clear all the backlog that we have.

Using the GUI will also make sure that the step we are following to upgrade the SRM are accurate and followed as per the instructions.

Another important task would be perform the pre-reqs to compile it as a report and give us a go no-go status.

Also, GUI will provide an interface to review the logs in single screen to monitor the progress of the task instead of monitoring the PS -EF command.
All the SRM upgrade backlogs can be completed in much advance than the expected time.
Reduced effort via simpler process guided by the GUI
Efficiency.
