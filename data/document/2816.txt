Internal File System migration tool for VNX File
Meets Global Product Operations Challenge and Engineering Operations and Services Challenge- Enhancement in the product, making the migration simpler, time saving and easier to user.

I came up with the idea while handling the migration projects and after studying the challenges we have currently with the EMCopy tool.
Since this idea came to  my mind I have been planning possible ways to leverage the VNX GUI and how the interface would look and what options it would support
1)Integrate EMCopy or add a feature on the VNX GUI for file level migrations other than existing replicator as it isnt capable of partial file system migrations.
2)The inbuilt migration tool could work as what EMCopy does however within the GUI we could have options to select the target path , target device .
3)It should be able to read folder level permissions and copy those permissions to the target paths as well.
4)Would have options on the GUI to run incrmental copies and switches etc that is being used currently in EMCopy. 
5)Would make the migrations simpler and easier to manage.

1)If this idea is successfully implemented the VNX OE will have to have a new option for Migrating, it would have options to select the type of migration we would like to perform.
2)The success of this idea would enhance productivity as we would be avoidi
