Improve supportability of cross product solutions, for data protection products from CTD
Our idea matches the sponsor challenge "CTD Supportability in 12 months or less" as we propose to build a new supportability tool in a cross product deployment which uses existing logs that are created by the CTD products. 
The proposed change to provide a better supportability tool does not require re-architecture or re-engineering of any CTD product and can be developed in 6-8 months.
I and my friend Karunakara Seelam have conceived this idea while having a general discussion to improve the supportability of product in CTD. We have not implemented the idea, but if the idea is accepted it can be implemented quickly in 6-8 months as mentioned above. 

The details of the idea is discussed in the below link;

Our idea solves the problem as it provides a quick visual display of the problem,  and also has the ability to set up alerts and email for the problems seen in a cross product deployment.Complex log analysis and exchanging email from the customer to know how the product is used is not required for troubleshooting the problem.
If we were to implement the idea, the product can be sold as a supportability/monitoring appliance that will be deployed in customer site. This appliance will gather the data from different products and provide a dashboard for the support/admin to monitor the product behavior.

Success of the project will be defined by ability for support to diagnose and detect the issues faster, provide a quick turn around time for support and a better customer experience
