Laptops power management system
Electricity wasted because large number of laptops/computers were not turned off after employees left office.
Most of time, my laptop starts so slow, and I have to wait the initialization for up to 10min even 20min. this is tough. 
So I choose make it be always on to avoid the long booting issue, which waste a lot of electricity.
Create a system to control the power of computers/laptops in office, provide below functions:
1. Turn off the computers/laptops which last the inactive status for a specific duration after working time.
2. Turn on the computer/laptops before employees arrive at office, additionally auto launch some specified applications, so the employees can easily start to work as soon as they arrive. 
It will save the cost on electricity and extend the life of our computers/laptops which also saved the cost of IT indirectly.
