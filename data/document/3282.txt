Cartoon show for children to introduce them to EMC products and concepts as Superheroes

Movies and Cartoons based on superheroes are very popular at the moment.  
We can partner with an animation company to produce a cartoon based on EMC products and concepts and present them as superheroes. For example we can use a superhero called Mr Symmetrix who is super strong, and another superhero called XtremIO who has super speed (like DC comics The Flash). We can also introduce characters to represent concepts such as a superhero who can turn into a Cloud. This cartoon can used as an educational tool to teach children complicated 3rd platform concepts in a fun and creative way!
