"EMC Loyalty Program" to Win the Competition and Maintain High TCE
TCE, Market Share Growth, Competition 
It's my genuine idea and I will be more than happy to help on drawing how this can be looks likes as I imagined it.
My idea is simple by having a special way to say “Thank You” for customers who decided to move from a competitor technology or solution and choose EMC. 

The way to do it, is by launching a program let's name it for example “EMC Loyal Customer” or “EMC Thanks Program”, where those customers will be able find resources (such as: eLearning Courses, Training Vouchers, Ask the Expert, etc.) as a special appreciation for replacing the current competitor solutions and choose us. We can provide a banner in our public website, with a special login access so they can find and leverage those benefits. 

What we will achieve from this? 

 1- It will show to those customers how we’re care and evaluate them for choosing EMC technologies and products.

 2- It will help the on field sales people to close the deals more quickly by prompting the program as a solution that will address customers’ inquiries/demands around “how to”, “lacking for EMC Resources & knowledge transfer”, etc.     

 3- It will help and support scoring high TCE results out of it at the end.


1- It will help EMC on field sales people to close more deals quickly by prompting the program as a solution that will address customers’ inquiries/demands around “how to”, “lacking for EMC Resources & knowledge transfer”, etc. as in many case those are the main cause of their resistance to move to new vendor's technologies. 

2- Generate more Professional Services demands from those new closed deals on this new pipeline.   

3- It will help and support scoring higher TCE's results.
