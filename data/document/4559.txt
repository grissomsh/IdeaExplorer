Reward mementos if any, to be of Gold / Silver (precious metals).

This is better than the using the regular mementos.
Employees, if supposed to get rewarded with memento for any event, should be given mementos of precious metals instead of something which may not have much value. Please note this suggestion is not to change the cash awards to mementos, but to use the precious metals for mementos instead of regular mementos. EMC imprinted Gold / Silver coins would be liked by all employees.
