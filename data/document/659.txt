Break Work Routine
N/A
I came up with this idea by always hearing the employees complaining about the work routine and the not getting a new experience from doing the same work everyday.
Each employee should be rotated to a different team in the same department to get a new experience from the other team by doing a different functions and processes. This can enhance the employee's productivity and satisfaction and will provide an opportunity for exposing to a new different experience. Also this will increase the awareness of the EMC employees' about the EMC culture, products and functions.
