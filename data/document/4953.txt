Get rid of backend daisy chain for VNX

We had dual power supply failure on CX960 which caused DU/DL and the subsequent DAE's were also powered OFF. If we have Infiniband kind of setup atleast the subsequent DAE's can be survived.
Rather than daisy chain, introduce Inifini band or fabric inter connect similar to Isilon or VCE for VNX backend. We can have a point to point connection where every DAEs is within one hop to another.
