Online Treasure Hunt

I'd conducted online treasure hunt for college symposium. And also I use to solve programming language treasure hunt like pythonchallenge.com etc etc..
Online treasure hunts are information-based scavenger hunts, or puzzle hunts, in which teams/individuals use their collective brainpower to solve clues. Each level will have some clues. Questions may be about EMC technology, current affairs or programming languages etc etc.
