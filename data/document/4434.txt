Training improvements

I have got this idea when I reading the challenges.
Generate a survey every quarter to get next quarters specific training requirement from all the departments and work out to release only those training to the employees will avoid the unwanted trainings and employees will get the specific trainings which is really required time to time to delver the best and to keep the knowledge of the employees to match the industries latest technological developments. This will be a very good step to drive EMC BPTW.
