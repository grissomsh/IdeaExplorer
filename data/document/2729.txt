EMC Customer Engineer (CE) rating portal
The idea is about enhancing the overall process of customer and support when customer engineers (CEs) are on-site.
As a support engineer, Sometimes i deal with CEs who are dealing with the product for their first time and i have to apologize to the customer and resend another engineer to perform the appropriate task. 
Having internal portal between Support/GS and field to rate the CEs and being able to escalate if any issues happen.
Field will have the ability to view report about each CE and comments in case he is lacking experience in some parts and they can provide them with appropriate trainings
-Letting customers have professional and good experience when we send trained/professional engineers on their sites to perform local tasks.
-Saving customer's time if he has critical issue.
-Making it easy for remote engineers to cooperate with on-site pe
