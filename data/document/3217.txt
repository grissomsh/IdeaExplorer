Storage distribution based on pattern

-
Data is stored in binary format. 
Patterns of binery bits that are frequenty used could be stored on pools that are always active. 

While patterns with less frequency are stored on other pools that could be set to standby to minimize the power consumtion and increase the disk life time.
