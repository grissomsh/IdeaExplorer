One has to rotate the pedal on a stationary bicycle while the spring inside it gets wound. Each rotation of one’s leg on the peddle wounds the spring once. The high tension spring in the bicycle stores energy. Once the energy is stored, the bicycle is made ready to keep it moving for as much distance that depends on the spring energy. Like the old winding watch, we peddle the bicycle at free time and while riding on the bicycle, we just sit on it to see the easy movement for a long distance. Manual pedaling can be replaced by any motor to make the rotations. More the spring’s capacity to rotate, more the energy gets accumulated and more the distance the bicycle travels. Options are to be made available to wind the spring while riding on the bicycle too.It also does not matter about the rpm at which the initial rotation is made. Also arrangements have to be made to not to use the stored energy when the bicycle moves downhill. Provision should be made to control the speed of the bicycle by controlling the spring unwinding speed. When the bicycle moves downhill, can make another spring to wind and the energy can be used in the similar way as mentioned.
One problem we face with this is as we rotate for winding, the spring may get fastened up and it may be harder to rotate further. For this we have gear, which is built in such a way that winding is easier and used in the same way we use in cycles today. Good quality tension springs with gear associated with it can be used for durable automatic bicycles.

This makes bicycles more advanced and better. This kind of bicycles can be sold at higher rates
