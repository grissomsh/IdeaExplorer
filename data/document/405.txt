Customer Feedback Tracker
Gathering the client feedback (escalations and appreciations) in a standard format is essential to assimilate the cause and drive improvements. TCE being the key metrics of all great organisations makes it even more important for us to do this on an ongoing basis.
This idea popped up in my mind as I had the liberty to experience and be part of a quality improvement assignment previously in my career. This enabled me to drive a green belt project to closureas well. The basic structure from these experiences were improvized after discussions with experts including my current management team and collegues. The technical knowledge of couple of my team member, namely Bharath and Vinay, helped develop this application in Quickbase.
Create an instance in QUICKBASE application to capture and report all CAPA cases (client escalations) and appreciations. Streamlining this data over a period of time will provide adequate information to use quality concepts like FMEA (Failure Mode and Effects Analysis) and identify and rectify key critical errors. The standard format used in the application will cater to all processes and will still keep the content in a standard way meeting quality requirements.
It is a definite value add to have atleast 6 months of this data that will help have a structured approach to improve quality issues.This will enable us to focus and drive improvements to eliminate top critical, top occcurring errors in process. Also it gives headway to common root causes for errors.Quality metrics will be the ideal measurement for the application. The solutioning part on eliminating key errors is a different process all together that is case specific.
