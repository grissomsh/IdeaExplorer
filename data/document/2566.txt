Diversity and innovation at a great place to work
My idea will help us to filter the candidates submitting their CVs to join EMC. 
This idea will give an equal chance to everyone all over Egypt to submitt and to understand what we (as EMC) are looking for.
I first had this idea when i tried to join EMC myself, i never thought that i can even apply as i am not an engineer ( faculty of commerce), i never knew that there is some departments here that do not require technical backgrounds. I doubted that what was written in my CV is enough to be a part of this huge company!So i needed to know a lot and i couldn't get any answers until I knew from my friends who are working here.
My idea is : to add an icon on EMC page on the internet (www.EMC company.com) that includes, qualifications required to join EMC. This page is accessible to everyone (none EMC), so me as a fresh graduate i can see what are the qualifications i need to join EMC, so i can prepare myself. we can divide it into 3 sections ( General qualifications / Technical persons / Non technical persons) 
General like : the languages we need, average age, bachelor degree... 
Technical persons: list of courses required, applications knowledge , technical background... 
Non technical persons : what are the departements that the non engineers can join whithin EMC, what are the qualifications needed in this person (ex:decision maker / creative ...) 
I can see that this will innovate the candidates and make them prepare very well to be a member here, this will also motivate all candidates all over Egypt as this  gives them the chance to apply if they are qualified. That way we will have different minds and different thoughts.
The idea will improve the quality and the diversity of the new members joining EMC, which will definitely improve the quality of the service provided to the customer, and will reflect on the customer satisfaction and will enhance the productivity.
