transform education in STEM in Africa and the around EMC communities 
Education is the main way to fight poverty and realize the prosperity for this world by putting the knowledge into action.
I thought about this initiative when I saw that there are many usages for our old servers and laptops that can give a hand to the primary and secondary schools specially for the far regions in the developing countries. I see that the need of these schools will not require a lot of resources.
EMC to establish eLearning centres in hundreds of schools across the countries we work in, supporting these centres and the schools through an innovative social enterprise model. The model not only provides the technology, but also delivers teacher training, maintenance, end of life recycling and crucially provides employment and volunteering
opportunities for local communities. It will be built by our old and retired laptops, and servers that can be used for other some years. EMC can offer this central Data center in a central place that can be accessed by the needy schools and centers of education in the selected countries.
EMC enables thousands of disadvantaged children to become digitally literate, giving them opportunities for further education and employment that would of been beyond their reach and ultimately allowing them and the communities they live in to break free of the
poverty cycle.

more details can be prepared in the incubation period.
this will involve EMC with the solutions of the world problems, and will give a good image about EMC role in transforming the education model in this beautiful continent.
