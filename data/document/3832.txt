Recording of Knowledge transfer 

As I was in Operations I missed a lot of Cross Bu trainings hence 
When ever there is Cross BU Knowledge session we can use the tools like Webex and any other free tools to record the ongoing proceedings and then post these recordings on a common share so that the people who have missed these seeions can see it at their leisure
