Express Install Build process improvement
N/A
We need to setup the connection of a new machine and console server to begin the Express Install build. Then we must file a ticket to ask labman for help which is inconvenient for developer to debug/test in a hurry.
Now Express Install script complete the classic install through the interactive with console server: detect the expected message and enter corresponding command. But if the connection lost suddenly or script didn't catch the expected message from console server, the build is stopped and failed. 

We can follow the ripit mechanism to complete the classic install without console server and then scribe the install image include Linux image and NAS software.


If we fully implemented this idea, we would reduce the risk of every official build and save engineers' time to investigate other technical error not the environmental issue.
