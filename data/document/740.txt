My idea is related to tele-communication and data archiving. We can provide a product which can satisfy the mobile users to archive and extract their previous phone conversations.
I saw my colleages facing problems due to convesations over phone in their life and see the conversation history is stored on the local memory of the phone only for few users. I observe this to be a common problem to every induvidual and hence we can use the existing technology to suffice the common need and which inturn generates revenue for our organization.
I recommend that we offer a solution to every mobile user to archive their previous phone conversations over internet at data storage location. This would allow them a enhanced security for all professional meetings and important conversations over phone. We can either implement this idea as an addition in the syncplicity product or launch it as new product.
If this idea is implemented, the outcome would be a product which would be very helpful to the company branding and revenue generation. It is a well known fact that the mobile phones (Android\IOS) are very much money making business. we can integrate this syncplicity product, which would definitlely add some out of box features and earn some revenue to our organization.
