Tool
We should have some tool; so that, Implementation team can update complete customer environment details before handing over the customer to support.
There were plenty of incidents were support didnt have any information of customer environment and support use to sturggule to get the information from the end user. 
As soon as Implementation team submit the request; it has to come to support and support will check all the details which is avialable in check list and take the handover after confirmaing from customer. 
1) Saves support engineer time.
2) Easy to pin point the issue. 
3) We will have all the information (Customer contact, Account manager, SAM)
