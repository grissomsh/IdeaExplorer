EMC World-Internal
This idea addresses the Ireland COE challenge by allowing EMC Business Units and federation partners to communicate and collaborate with EMC employess by presenting their relevant platforms and products to employees in the Ireland COE.

 
This idea was generated by the Cork GDE team. The Team has experience collaborating with many EMC BUs and product teams but feel there exists very little exposure to the wider EMC federation.

The Business Solution Demo Day will have systems physically set up within the Ireland COE. Employees can experience an overview of existing or new product solutions and develop and understanding of EMCâ€™s products/platforms and solutions as part of the Demo Day. Employees will have the ability to browse this area, ask questions and be shown real time demonstrations by Bunisness Unit experts.

The Business Solution Demo Day would address communication/Collaboration between EMC employees and the Federation.

Win for Ireland COE.
Win for EMC Federation partners.
Win for employees.
