Integration of EMC tools
It is always challenge to keep different links and user accounts to access EMC tools. Currently We have unique links and user accounts existing for accessing EMC tool/ information's (E.g.: EAS, Propel, Transport, payroll...etc)
I have experienced and heard from my colleagues with the challenge in accessing EMC tools. Currently We have unique links and user accounts existing for accessing EMC tool/ information's (E.g.: EAS, Propel, Transport, payroll)
We should have a single Website and all links should appear under that. Access to the links should be provided / restricted to NT user account.
If the solution completely implemented, there will a single point for all organization tool/ information. This will enable users to save time and eazy access to EMC tools.
