Building EMC - One EMC

Watching brilliant ideas fade away just for the lack of visibility.
•	To foster interpersonal growth and cross functional collaboration among GS family, an event has to be organized monthly/quarterly that will comprise of four community events namely technology, fun, CSR, GD through an app based medium
•	Managers along with his team will nominate best people pertaining to each event based on the individual’s interest, skill, personality and experience.
•	Selected participants will be acknowledged through a token of appreciation in the form of goodies, tags, smileys or business cards highlighting that the top management is aware, listening and engaging in their personal growth.
•	The app will have four forums for respective events highlighting 
	Objectives
	Problems faced
	Potential resolution and 
	A space to put forward the feedback by any employee.

•	As soon as an idea is put forward in the form of feedback, a trigger will be sent to the leader of that event; the leader will highlight the feedback and notify that this idea will be considered.
•	The ideas selected will find place in the main event and contributors of these ideas will be rewarded.
•	At the inauguration of the App, a mail/ Comms will be sent to all the employees to put their feedback in their event of interest.


For a start I have thought of these events to be incorporated in the App :
Technology: Conducting contest like Idea challenge of the Quarter related to latest trends in technology followed by Brainstorming sessions, Quiz-Maths.
Fun: A set up like “People’s Court” where people can post their views and opinions and get feedback from their managers and colleagues and share funny anecdotes and light banter.
CSR: Educating the employees what CSR EMC is involved in and coordinating with the volunteers who are running the NGOs about hygiene, health tips and other social causes that can be taken up.
GD : To discuss economic times, current affairs, technology infrastructure, science and weaponry, research and development etc.
