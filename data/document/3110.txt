Better Bangaluru Through Technology

This idea came into my mind after receiving email on this subject "Better Bangaluru Through Technology".


My recommendation to all IT companies of Bangaluru is that they start seeing their infra set- up divided  into zones and establish facility in each Zone. Employees should/can use nearest zone's facility.

Product teams should have designated project/product area into each zone's office with a display panel that displays live views of the project/product teams from other zone's offices to get the visual feeling. 
Use Video conferencing for the meetings that require F2F interaction. Use Email and other channels of communication as usual.

The above explained model will address problems as mentioned in previous section without any impact on productivity. In fact this will bring operational cost down to a greater extent because IT companies don't have to rent a space in expensive Tech Parks instead they can utilize small buildings in less expensive areas. This will also help in equal development of all the ares.
Tech park builders will not have huge demand for new infra and will not cut trees. City will develop in planned way and citizens will have choices.
