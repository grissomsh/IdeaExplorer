Proactive Support Model -- Cloud-Based Resolution

We have provided some data collection, reduction and presentation tooling to consolidate information including overview and temporal profiles available for review and diagnosis with only a few clicks of the mouse.  For several years we have been using Twitter (non sensitive data only and controlled access) to provide notification of test results.  A while back we started to apply these techniques to the support environment however product and organization tree changes caused things to be dropped.  Recently there has been a resurgence of interest in these techniques and technologies to address customers with very demanding SLA requirements.  We have since prototyped and demonstrated some extensions to the basic model with great CS and customer feedback.
Using a mix of on site and offsite components with modern push techniques to create a support infrastructure that is responsible for quickly and automatically making available the data required to respond to and resolve problems.  This improves both support reaction time as well as resolution time.
This layered approach is a coordinated application of several layers of data streams using new as well as conventional data delivery mechanisms to expedite problem resolution.  For high speed notification: controlled use of social media (Twitter) to provide virtually instant (< 1 minute) notification of issue.  Simultaneously initiate collection of array log files and application data, and provide notification when done as to where the data has been delivered locally (customers private cloud).  Simultaneously, and if allowed, deliver (FTP) information back to EMC (our private cloud) and provide additional notifications.
