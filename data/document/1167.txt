EMCgivesback - A fully participating event.
This is to make “EMCgivesback” a culture across EMC and an opportunity for every employee to participate in this event.
This thought came from seeing many organisations participate in different events
but not everyone is able to contribute to it.
while interacting with friends who are part of other corporates and different events run in their organisations.
1.Come up with more number of Social & environmental activities. Some of them are listed below.
2.One or two teams will participate in these events for a day.
3.Events could be run though out the year by making the entire COE participate in teams.
4.There could be ample amount of break/Interval during critical business times. Like, QTR ends based on business requirement.
5.Having the activities once or twice a year per team may not affect the business requirements. 
6.To conduct these activities in work hours will give an opportunity for everyone to participate.
7.Assign the team with one particular activity and educate them to complete it efficiently.
8.Monitor the activities and guide the team to finish it well.
9.Have a committee to design, execute and guide through the events.
10.Have rewards for the best team who did their job to the mark and made a greater impact.
11.Annual awards for such events will bring lot of joy and pride to the respective teams.
12.At the same time, involve people to come up with new events, new activities and get feedback to make the events best in class.
13.Give options for people to pick from a number of events listed, so they are not forced to work for a particular event.

•Awareness programs like, traffic rules. Keep the city clean. Preserve water. Segregate waste etc.
•Cleanup drives like, Clean the roads. Close the deadly pot holes. Plant trees. Preserve/Clean lakes. 
•Visit to schools/Orphan/Old age centers with a purpose like, help children to learn and achieve more. (Which we have been already doing). Extend the same support to the orphanage and old age homes. Paint their walls. Clean up the centers and make it look vibrant & happy. Bring them toys. Spend valued time with the kids and elderly. Boost their confidence and energy.
•Environmental/Health drives like, marathons. Cycle rides. Walk & Jog events. Clean the parks. Make space for the trees and plants to grow and preserve them.
•It will be a great team building activity and make us more responsible towards society.
•This will help EMC participate in Social & environmental events fully.
•A great EMC culture.
•EMC will lead as an example to the rest.
•Last but not the least, definitely will serve the community around you.
