Mobile Apps can be created for raising Service request and to capture survey

There was a sev-1 issue in our account, where Data Domain disk needs to be replaced and I was travelling when I get the notification. It was very tough time for me to raise an SR for the critical issue. I thought that if we an App created for EMC SR will be a good idea.
* Mobile App needs to be developed.
* Service Request can be raised over the App.
* Survey can be captured easily to track Customer satisfaction.
