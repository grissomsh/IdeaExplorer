Pop IT Technology sharing
N/A
during work I found someone may  know a new IT Technology and other one know anther IT Technology.
so I think sharing with each other is necessary.

We can have a knowledge sharing meeting once a month , in the meeting one can speak a knowledge point first , the knowledge may be a solved ar or a new IT Technology  then others can discuss it. 
everyone can learn more knowledge and promote common progress
