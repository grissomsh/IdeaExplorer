Entered Contracts Report
Our goal is to identify the contracts which are getting missed as renewal opportunity and fix them.
Set-up a warranty  for Entered contracts to  ensure customer gets a proper support and services during warranty period. 

Idea has come-up when we received an query  from customer to check why products are not covered under warranty period though he is already paid. 
Analysis part is completed and approached BTG group to find out the root cause under WR#414031
In discussion with management to decide on clearing of backlog
Currently there are 15523 (30% are SAP SOâ€™s and remaining 70% are Catalyst) contracts in OKS systems which needs to be fix manually. 
Work with IT (BTG-Group ) Identify and fix  system glitch to avoid contracts falling in Entered status.
Pull   Entered status report on periodical bases and fix manually if there is any system fallouts.
If 25% of these contracts are getting quoted then also it will be huge revenue to EMC.
Customer will get proper support and services for which he is entitled during warranty period.
Renewal sales rep will get notification on time, which will help them to reach customer with renewal quotation well in advance. 
10-15% volume reduction in entitlement process and reduction in manual work.
