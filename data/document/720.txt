Kids nursery 
My idea will help the working moms to keep their jobs or at least to find a solution to help them work more easily.
Not a personal history but in everywhere i worked before i saw moms quitting their jobs for not having a suitable place to leave their kids in.
My idea is to have  kids nursery at work or somewhere close that has the same working hours as moms do, as its not easy to find a nursery that working late.
It doesn't have to be for free it can have a daily or monthly subscription but it would be great if EMC would facilitate something like that, if it happens im sure many moms will really appreciate it.
It will have a huge benefit to help EMC not to lose its experienced employees for a temporary period or even permanently. will increase employees satisfaction that will definitely will encourage them to give back to work.
