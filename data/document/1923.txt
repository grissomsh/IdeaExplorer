Smart devices connected by mobile app using Pivotal Cloud Foundry mobile services
Smart devices are one of the most important entry for big data. With the rise of smart phones and smart devices, there's thousands of thousands of devices connected to the network, which generate countless data every minute. Pivotal Cloud Foundry mobile services not only faciliate the development for mobile app, it also has great capacity analysing the data generated by smart devices.
These days, smart devices(IOT) become hotter and hotter. Unfortunately, there're lots of challenges remaining to be addressed including devices binding,communication,security,scalability,big data banalysis and so on so forth. Fortunately, Pivotal Cloud Foundry mobile services can address these issues in a perfect manner.
What's more, our team has done some pre-research of PoC based on Pivotal Cloud Foundry mobile services. We believe that this new market can benefit largely from EMC's products and solutions.
-- Smart devices and app communicate with each other based on the mechanism of "subscribe/push". In this way, app and device can bind with each other. Push Notification is the key feature of Pivotal Cloud Foundry mobile services. We can leverage this feature to implement the communication binding/communiation between smart devices and app.
-- Security and scalability of IOT remains a challenge. In our solution, we will leverage enterprise-level security and scalability provided by Cloud Foundry to ensure the highest security and scalability of IOT.
-- Countless data will be generated by the thousands of thousands of smart devices in every minute. We will use big data analysis provided by the Pivotal Cloud Foundry to mine valuable information from the data.  
Our idea can provide our customers with total soltuon of smart devices(IOT) including app developing, security and big analysis. Smart devices are one of the most important entry for big data in the short future. So it can help EMC make big money in the transformation towards big data era.
