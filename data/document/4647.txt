EMC’s Virtual Demo Platform

Have been involved in EBC demos for many customers alongwith lot of POC items. It takes lot of effort from Engineering to build the Demos/respond to the queries. Moreover the response is people dependent which can be so critical in some circumstances that we may loose the deal itself rest aside the Low TCE.

More details around implementation is @
https://inside.emc.com/docs/DOC-99880
Create a virtual platform that has videos/bites/customer references. All this information is granular @
	Product Level – Example : NetWorker
	Release Level  - NetWorker : Version 8.2 – What’s new ?
	Solution Level – NetWorker with RSA lockbox or NetWorker with Vsphere
	Workflow Level – NetWorker Licensing or NetWorker DataDomain BOOST

User can browse at any level and get the video/references. We can also provide the information/videos in various category based on how much content is needed
	Basic – High Level Info in the form of small content or quick demo
	Advanced – All the information available in the form of all the relevant excerpts and a comprehensive demo

Content/Demos are accessible (Access Controlled) to anybody on web/mobile 
Hits will be recorded that will create the behavioral pattern and an input to PRD/Roadmaps
Incase customer doesn’t find content/demo, we will have 48 hours SLA to come back to him with information.
