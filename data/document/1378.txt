Virtual and Enhanced Customer Tour
Customers regularly tour the Cork COE. One idea to emhance this is a web app that will lead customers around the plant in their own language. Also this app could be used to provide a virtual tour to online customers.
I was part of setting up the ESS customer station. One of the issues we faced was the noise and differeing languages customers will have. 
An app customers can use on mobile devices which give a commentary of the area they are in, in the langiuage they are most familiar with. Also, using GPS, a self lead customer tour might also be a possibility. And for customers not able to come to the COE, a virtual tour could be available.  
This idea is about enhancing the customer experience when here in EMC, and raising the profle of EMC and the COE.
