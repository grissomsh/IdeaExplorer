Build network 
I think this idea is relevant as it looks at building communication and collaboration on projects between employees. 
I came up with this idea when I was interested in sales and wanted to find the right person to talk to in sales about moving job positions. 
I would like there to be a platform on Ireland COE page that employees can refer to in order to develop networks with other employees in EMC and with EMC partners. This idea would run similar to Twitter/ Facebook as each employee would have a profile of likes/ dislikes. Employees could then communicate on a professional basics and get to know new people with similar interest.  
I think this platform would improve communication and additionally collaboration as they can meet me people with similar interest. I would hope this idea would be greatly beneficial for new employees as they can find out what employees work in other sectors.
