Identifying Opportunities to Migrate Legacy Systems to Cloud-Based Solutions
Enterprise Content Division (ECD) offers a number of resources that can help business owners realize the benefits of cloud-based computing. Although every company’s situation is unique in some ways, they all share the need to determine which software solutions are most appropriate for their needs. Far too many business owners, though, lack the expertise or in-house resources to make these determinations effectively (Alijani, Fulk & Adnan, 2014), a constraint that forms the focus of this response to the ECD Challenge.
Software offerings such as xPlore (search server), Documentum (content management software), SyncP, CTS (transformation services) and SaaS among others can be used in EMC core technologies, including storage, cloud and virtualization platforms. 
While many business owners may be comfortable with their existing computer systems and have them fine-tuned to their specific needs, most also realize that there will come a time when their business needs will outgrow their computing capabilities. As a result, most business owners are always on the lookout for superior alternatives that can save them money, improve customer service, and provide them with a competitive advantage. Not surprisingly, many business owners might also be contemplating a cloud-based solution simply because of all of the recent hyperbole in the mainstream media. As Maintner (2011) points out, “Cloud computing is suddenly all the rage. Turn on the television and you'll see commercial after commercial encouraging us to ‘move to the cloud’” (p. 53). Likewise, according to Rohit Ghai, president of the Enterprise Content Division, “Cloud is everywhere after all” (2015, para. 3). 
With so much time, effort and money invested in their existing IT resources, though, some business owners might be highly reluctant to even consider alternatives and may be unwilling to learn more about cloud-based solutions in the first place. Nevertheless, a critical juncture awaits all business owners with respect to their existing computing resources and the time will come when their business needs require some type of viable solutions. In many cases, the solution may be highly complex. For instance, Gill (2011) points out that for many business owners, their legacy systems are characterized by “software that's three or more versions old” which is “the legacy of decades of on-premise (in-house) software deployments, incremental releases that never seemed worth the pain of a major upgrade migration project, and fear of losing critical customization” (p. 44).
Further, even though some business owners may be aware of cloud-based solutions, it is reasonable to suggest that some lack the expertise or in-house information technology (IT) resources need to migrate their legacy data to this alternative platform (Bradley & Cooper, 2014). Moreover, it is also reasonable to suggest that many business owners are reluctant to take advantage of the services offered by ECD based on a lack of information concerning the cost, time and resources needed to effect this transition. Therefore, by providing business owners with the information they need to determine the optimal process by which the migration of legacy information to a cloud-based platform, more of them will be able to take advantage of the powerful IT tools available from ECD such as xPlore, Documentum, SyncP, CTS and SaaS. The information needed could be provided in online, interactive tool that business owners could use to identify how much time would be involved in a transition initiative, what the estimated costs would be, and what steps the company would need to take preparatory to such a transition.

A fully incubated and implemented version of this solution would appear as an online, interactive information source that would guide business owners through the decision-making processes needed to determine which cloud-based solution is best suited to their IT requirements and identify what steps they need to take preparatory to such a migration. Each set of questions could accompanied by a link that provides small business owners with additional information concerning the specific product offerings available through ECD that would highlight the advantages of this resource for their companies. 
This solution would not only provide business owners with a valuable resource for determining how best to proceed, it would encourage them to take advantage of the ECD offerings in the process. For example, some pro forma questions and responses that such online resource could contain include the following:
•	Are flexibility and scalability extremely important to your business? Do you lack the dedicated IT resources to deploy and manage your own hardware? Consider a cloud-based SaaS solution from ECD. 
•	Does your business store a large amount of sensitive data or work in a highly regulated industry? Perhaps a virtualized on- premises solution built with the support of a partner such as ECD’s xPlore and Documentum Platform 7.1 would be best suited for your company. 
•	Does your business have significant amounts of legacy system data and hard copy information that requires transformation for use in a new computer system? Consider ECD’s Content Transformation Services (CTS). 
•	Do your technology needs span all these scenarios, requiring the unique benefits of a hybrid cloud solution? You may want to consider leveraging ECD on-premises Syncp services augmented with the benefits of their cloud-based tools (adapted from The Windows Server 2003 era is ending: What it means for small & midsize businesses and how to plan for migration, 2015, p. 37).
