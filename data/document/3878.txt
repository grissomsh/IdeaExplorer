Screen catcher plus file version for 3D models collaboration

Large amount of data with long latency is very difficult for real-time collaboration, so we'd rather reduce the size of transferred data as much as we can. Still I think change the application might be a better way, if we can not change the application, we could also add some other monitor to help us reduce the data. But this method is kind of specific to certain application.
The time for continuous and large amount of data replication would make the real-time collaboration difficult. If we use a screen catcher to catch all the mouse/keyboard input for the 3D application and send these operation data package to other system, this will save a lot of time in the data transferring. This will not change the application, but rather add one daemon attached to the application.  After the other system got the operation data package, it will apply the same operation on its application, which shows the 3D model effect from the first system, and write to local datasets file at the same time. To keep the consistency  among different sites, we would need file versioning, which combines the file version with the operation data packages, so that different system could always keep records of the changes.
