Big Data Analytics approach for EMC products continuous enhancement
 The idea aims at monetizing EMC infrastructure log and config data to provide actionable insights and to achieve continuous product improvement

 The idea did stem from the application of big data analytics in social media to process the customer reviews. I started to visualize EMC arrays as the customer and the logs to be their reviews describing the status, errors and events happening to them.
 The idea works as follows:

-	EMC arrays logs and configuration files are periodically collected and moved to a central warehouse
-	The warehouse will be divided into data marts. Each data mart will be specialized to one EMC product (for example: warehouse for VNX logs and data)
-	Big Data analytics techniques will run centrally on the huge amount of logs and data collected from thousands of arrays.
-	Big data techniques used are like :
o	association techniques to detect relations between different issues and problem triggers
o	time series analysis to monitor array behavior over time and detect seasonality of the issues (if any)
-	after processing the data, a report will be returned to the Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) team and the product engineering team denoting the possible issues/bugs 
-	the engineering and development team do their tests and take corrective action.


1.	Early detection of issues and bugs
2.	Prompt issue resolution 
3.	Automation of the issue reporting makes life easier
4.	The ability to monitor huge amount of arrays data at the same time
