Giving Back to Our community
The idea is matching the challenge as it brings numbers of volunteers to those STEM schools,and other places who need them for such community services
Me and my colleague Heba were discussing how much people we know have skills and want to be volunteers but they just don't know the right place to go and if there will be others like them 
Create a portal with registration button where people who have skills like:painting,cooking,drawing,playing music..etc. will be registered giving their information, describing their skills in details and the places they can offer them.
if this idea is implemented,the community we live in will be a better one,number of ignorants will decrease,we'll have a good generation with brilliant minds
