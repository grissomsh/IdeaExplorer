EMC Cooperative multi-user text editing over the internet.
The Contemporary Workplace or The Cooler Office - The contemporary office is a global office.  It shouldn't matter where you and your co-workers sit, with technology it should feel like we are always sitting right beside each other.
I have used similar tools for several years at other companies and on my own.  Unfortunately, EMC blocks these types of tools from being used on company equipment and therefore not readily available to teams.  Having collaborative and cooperative tools available will allow for us to be more efficient and productive no matter where we are or with whom we work with.  This is not a new idea by any means.  It is a true and tested concept that has been successfully incorporated into many companies daily workflow.  Before joining EMC, it was an essential part of my daily process.  The "idea" is to incorporate this type of tool here at EMC where it is lacking.
Screen sharing is only one tool for working collaboratively online.  By being able to co-create/write a single document at the same time as multiple users allows for faster collaboration from unlimited access points.  You shouldn't have to be in the same physical room to be able to contribute, you shouldn't have to have one person take notes, you shouldn't have to save and email a single document over and over again, you shouldn't be required to save a document before the next person can edit it.   Being able to share one single document also addresses version control issues (ie. which document is the latest or most accurate).  
My idea could be as easy and simple as allowing for an existing 3rd party tool/application such as Google Drive or MoonEdit to be used in its full capacity here at EMC.  Other options would be to purchase or build a custom system to meet the requirements that the existing tools lack.  It has serious potential to save money, improve communication, and enhance overall productivity.
