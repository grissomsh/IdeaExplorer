Internal Job Postings web site

Just a thought
Solution:-

Provide a employee IJP portal which is transparent and is easy to track information.
Every employee must have his profile in the system and must be easy to apply at any time.
An automated way of mailing to all the peers with what ever subject line it needs to be.
Every employee's profile must be updated wrt his duration in the company and different BU's he has worked etc etc

The idea of having a separate IJP portal look more systematic and transparent.
