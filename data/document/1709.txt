Traffic solution for Smart City
The challenge is trying to solve the traffic and transportation problem in smart cities. My idea is trying to solve this problem using the EMC products that can be combined together to provide a solution to determine the location of traffic congestion and to guide the car drivers to use alternate routes.                                                                                    
Some mobile applications are already used nowadays to determine the congested routes but most of them are not accurate because the routes' status are determined by the mobile application users and not based on reading and records of the sensors and cameras which will be more accurate.
My idea is to use a mobile application that can be used by the car drivers to determine their destination and the route that they are going to use and based on the results being collected from the surveillance cameras and the image processing occurred on the videos  or the records of the speeds of the cars from the GPS using the mobile application, we can know if the route is congested and we can suggest another route for the car driver. At the same time the user can choose the parking that he will use and based on the records of the number of cars in this parking we can confirm the availability of a place for the car or suggest another parking to be used.
I suggest to use isilon storage solution in my idea for its high processing performance that is needed with big data analysis tools like hadoop in order to make image processing on the records of surveillance cameras and to make analysis on these results to determine if the route is congested or not and to find which route is not congested to be recommended for the car driver and which parking can be used.    
The idea reduces the amount of time spent by the car driver (customer) in the traffic congestion and solves the traffic problem in the large cities.
