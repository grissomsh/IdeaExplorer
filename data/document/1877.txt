I-LOFAR  Ambitious project EMC Opportunity
I-LOFAR  (vhttp://www.lofar.ie)  is an ambitious project to build a next-generation radio telescope that is currently being deployed across Europe, with stations already operating in the Netherlands, Germany, Sweden, the UK and France. LOFAR will revolutionize studies into transient stars and galaxies; conduct the first studies into the early universe after the Big Bang and complete the most extensive surveys of galaxies at low frequencies.  Other applications include geophysics, meteorology, and agriculture.
Interest in science and technology. 
EMC should become an industrial partner and computing consultant to this project.  It is already involved in coderdojo, VEX robotics and other STEM projects. This will step –up the company’s involvement in the wider international scientific community and brand EMC as a technological leader in providing expertise in data analytics and cloud computing.  
Larger exposure for EMC in the market place. Possible future market opportunities in the area of science similar to gas and oil exploration. Make EMC a household name with tighter links to universities as a provider of solutions.
