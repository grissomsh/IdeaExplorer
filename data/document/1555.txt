EHC high level dashboard APP for portable devices(mobile or pad)
With this solution, we can improve Customer Experience on EHC.
Portable devices APPs are so popular and convienent, there are many products support it. Why not EHC?
There are two steps for we to meet this requirement:

- step 1 - collect EHC status data from intranet and publish it to public internet:  A tool that can reguraly fetch EHC status data, which is needed by APP, and store the data to a db that can be accessed through internet. This tool can be standalone tool or module embeded to EHC.  
- step 2 - An APP,that can access the EHC status data through public internet and transfer the data into graphic presetation, will be developped and installed to mobile phone or pad.

Then the high level customer can see the EHC status through their mobile phone or pad at any time, anywhere.
The more convienent the customer feel, the more successful EMC will be.
