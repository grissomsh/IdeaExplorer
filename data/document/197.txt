EMC Cohorts Program
One aspect of diversity is learning from others and one way to learn is debating with others.
I have first hand experience of the benefits of this kind of program.
Create an EMC Cohort Program. Cohort structure is following:
1. Each cohort has a cohort leader.
2. There are 8-10 participants in each cohort and they are 2 levels below in the Organization hierarchy. For example, if the cohort leader is a VP, then the cohort members are Director and few Sr. Manager people.
3. The members should not be in the direct org of the leader.
4. The agenda, topic and content for the cohort should be maintained by the central team.
5. The content should be geared toward the strategy and goals of the function. For example, IT Cohort Program can focus on ITaaS or 3 Platform or similar topics whereas Engineer Cohort can focus on other topics.
6. Cohorts are actively encouraged by the leader to share their perspective openly and freely. To support that openness, whatever is discussed in Cohort remains within the cohorts.

This can be piloted in a function such as IT and can start with Management cohorts before expanding to cohorts for IC.
I believe that this will
- Increase employee engagement and awareness about the diverse employee base that we have at EMC
- Increase the relationship between the diverse group of people
- Provide a forum to get a different perspective and idea around key strategies from a diverse group of people
