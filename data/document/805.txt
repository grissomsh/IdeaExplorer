CS Service Request Inspection Process
Improve Customer Service Request inspection process
Working as Isilon support manager, I found a problem with Service inspection process hence I thought of defined process to be followed by managers quarterly to ensure high quality service handling which will impact positively customer satisfaction
- Management to share CSAT surveys that are below target with team members for learned lessons
- Improve and Communicate New Support procedures
- Management team to make three customer calls weekly to collect customer feedback on active Service Requests
- Project Lead to prepare Service Request Inspection scorecard
- Managers/Supervisors Collect  Random  Service 
Requests at EOQ
- Inspect  the Service Requests and  complete Inspection Scorecard
- Manager checks individual Technical Support Engineer Quarterly Average Score
- Share  Inspection score and comments to TSEs
individually
- Review Service Request Inspection Process metrics with managers for continuous improvement

The main focus of this project is to improve Quality of Service Request handling
We couldnâ€™t realize exact financial figures
However, such quality initiative has positively impacted Customer handling and satisfaction, as CSAT composite score went up from 87.5% to 91.2%
