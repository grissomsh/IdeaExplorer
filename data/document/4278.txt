EMC Gives Back - In the Cloud

As an employee I am aware of a stream of worthy actions that are taking place under the 'EMC Gives Back' initiative.  These actions have been very impactful for employees, EMC and the recipients.   
As an active member of Scouting Ireland, I would love to be able to offer this  organization something like this.  
EMC gives back is an initiative where EMC finds ways to give back to communities. EMC can reach out to non-profit charitable and community organizations to make deployment of their Web Sites to the hybrid cloud an option.  
EMC would offer of Hybrid Cloud services to worthwhile charitable and community organizations at or below cost price.
EMC employees with the requisite knowledge in setting up the Hybrid Cloud, would volunteer their time to assist in the setting up of subscribers in Hybrid Cloud.
Once piloted, the scheme would be a great story to tell about how EMC gives back.
