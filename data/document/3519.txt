Dancing Day (Quarterly)

The never changing daily routine needs a change every once in a while to refresh everyone.
We would simply decide on a day per quarter when everyone would go dance. There could also be themes like oldies, country music.....etc. This would most definitely raise the spirit amongst the team members but the daily work will not be affected at all.
