Globalizing EMC Teams 
My idea is about breaking the virtual silos which may impact and slow down business success in a Multinational Corporate due to Geographical, Cultural, Language, Ideological differences, the ultimate goal is focusing only on business success and changing the world to be a better place.
The idea came when I started reading about big companies started revisiting the hierarchy management structure and moving to a more flat management models and also when I have experienced working with real global teams in EMC and seen the invaluable benefits of the global mindset rather than local or Geo specific mind set ,it amplifies everything, Productivity, Quality, Process Improvement ...etc. 
Changing the way we think about how to face business challenges and pursue goals from a local Geo specific or COE specific thinking to a global challenge by creating virtual teams from All EMC COEs / Offices to work together on business functions and integrate all the Global Talent and Skill Mix for the creation of holistic solutions which can help the global business achieve its goals, that may lead to change in our management structures, move towards working on shared tools and files on the cloud, add more TP/VC rooms to our offices to remove the Geo difference and get the utmost from the 3rd platform technology.
Changing the way we structure our teams will improve productivity (no one will care who will get the credit), boost Innovation (The impact of diversity and complementing skills) and  My analogy is simple, when I succeed to bring my team's minds together to think about a problem and give them the guidance, tools and support --> they create solutions I have never imagined and change the way we do business in many cases so what would be the impact of putting the global minds together and break the silos?
