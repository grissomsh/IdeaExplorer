EMC Car Pooling
The problem we are facing here in Egypt is the traffic problem. 
The initiative is to carpool and help reducing the parking problem.

My solution would help EMC not only benefit from using less cars to park and helping the environment, but also building relationships between the employees and getting to know everyone.
The transportation system will benefit from the idea as employees that use transportation might not need it all the time. 
Also the parking space will benefit as there will be less cars.
