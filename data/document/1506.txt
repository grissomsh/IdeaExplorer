Have you installed FedOps mobile app? - (Employee Collaboration & Federated Solutions Platform)
Our solution empowers EMC & Federation Groups by bringing the power of software to communications. It integrates telephony, voice, web conferencing, presence, and instant messaging into one seamless experience. Meanwhile, this proposal extends the Lync software platform with revolutionary EMC applications that meet an expanding variety of business, social, mobile and communications needs. This app stack will send proactive notifications of available solutions to all elite customers by RSS Feeds, Texting, Twitter hash tags, etc.
We are basically working in IT Digitization-Automation group and came up with an idea for this challenge after doing a brain storming session for few days.
Basically, a new application stack (Called as "FedOps") should be built for this requirement. This application stack will connect to EMC, VMware, RSA & Pivotal communities for better information & awareness of technical problems faced by customers/sales/partners, status on solutions delivery, innovative methods for better improvements in existing process.

How this works in real-time?

    o How does the FedOps work for both individuals, SSZ, Domain Experts & Customers?

Issues within Federation employees, Requirements, Product Enhancements will be pooled together & will be published with the help of "MASTER-DB" to SSZ Individuals, Domain Experts, Technical Account Managers, Community Bloggers on unsolved issues, complex problems & automation oriented solutions. This helps the pooled professionals to display or demonstrate skills in a wide range of cloud computing, big data, network, storage, pivotal topics. Teams can work together to help each other complete individual tasks.

    o How does the FedOps helps further?

Task Organization - Our idea will be much easier to navigate the hundreds of tasks available with a “sort-by” option on the main Task tab. Customers, TAM, Bloggers can choose the task view from three different (EMC, VMware, Pivotal) organizational views. This view will be saved in preferences if anybody leave the page, so he or she will always be able to come back to it. If somebody would like to change organizational view, simply need to choose a different option.

    o What does the FedOps leverage to further?

    o Does FedOps leverage REMOTE CONNECTIVITY or Dail Home features?

Experts get additional information, logs, product versions, exact issues & action already taken in place to solve customer problem. FedOps will leverage/collect/review the machine data generated by ESRS (remote connectivity) applications built by all EVP organizations. By leveraging automatic log analysis technologies, fixing the problem or reduction in RCA can be done to a great extent.
