Dash board Creation for everyday monitoring.

I am in support for last 6 years and found that no correct tool that tells what is required. Tools either have too much of info,  which takes a while to figure out what the issue is or no tools to check few metrics. Also we need a central one tool to look for all assets I support, not like I login in specific to on asset and then to other etc. Also I want a application based views and metrics.
Dash board creation is helpful for every user. There are tools like SRM that show very brief information. This idea of customized dashboard is better used to simplify what is required and what should the user want to get projected. This is like more of application centric and best for heterogeneous environments. 

Situation:
Considering a user having a VMX (Tier1), vnx(Tier2), Some NAS blades(Tier3) and with backup protection on Avamar and Networker (Tier -5). They have four MC and four BC and few testing environments. Their requirement is to see capacity management metrics /Performance metrics/ Application centric metrics like What  Tier1/2 storage is used and what is available. What hosts failed with backups, what is the peak time for the exchange application running high on IOPS, All HW issues reported on storage assets. These metircs which are not complicated , but gives lot info at first look on what is to be checked by support person to get a break fix. As a manager he knows when to order new storage or what can be migrated from Tier 1 to Tier2 based on usage etc, helps in decision making. To make this simple we can gather the logs from storage/BRS arrays few times a day. If performance to be monitored we need like 5 min interval data can be obtained from BPT and NR files. BRS array do not need metrics for performance.
