Altai - Agile Light Test Automation Infrastructure
Improve programmer and test engineer ability to quickly create and execute automation scenarios
As part of QE testing we had to perform a very large scale of test cases with limited resources and had only 2 months to do the work of 5 people.
We started to brainstorm about a good automation solution to mitigate the challenge - other automation solutions weren't generic and adaptive enough to allow the full functionality we needed to cover.
So, we decided to choose a "grow as you need" architecture - so we started by creating a simple infrastructure that loaded a function library that was expanded as time allowed during testing.
The end result allowed us to use the automation infrastructure for a wide range of test scenarios and to easily prepare scenario run commands that developers and testers can use.
First version is already implemented and widely used within ScaleIO test teams.
Additional test groups are showing interest in utilizing this testing infrastructure.

I propose a test automation infrastructure which is:
Multi platform - supports Windows, Linux, ESX
Lightweight - written in scripting language
With no set-up time (copy-paste) - deploy VM and ready to go
No programming knowledge required for utilizing it
Fully extendible - supports addition and enrichment of existing test building-blocks
Requires only scripting level knowledge to enrich existing functionality
First version is already implemented and widely used within ScaleIO test teams.
I would consider success as wide acceptance of my solution by internal and external teams.
It will save money by shortening test cycles.
Improve customer satisfaction by finding bugs early in the life cycle by automation scenarios and in a timely manner.
