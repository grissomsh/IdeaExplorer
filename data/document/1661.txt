-Adding compliance button for cases opened by partners to rate their performance
the customer can rate and give his feedback on the TSE/Engineer working with him which is critical for the levels of service presented , adding a compliance button for the customer can also add so much to the process efficiency to rate the partner's performance , commitment and focus on the issue
I am a TSE in NetWorker team , and I came across a service request where there was a compliance button for rating few elite partner's performance on the SR. I believe it was the best cooperation I got during my 5-months experience , I always got prompt update from the partner , he was technically very capable and thorough on the case updates which led to a more efficient performance and faster resolution to the case

My solution is that the engineer can acquire the privilege to rate the partner internally with the sales/accounting team through a compliance button which could have sub-tabs to indicate the customer is well trained/technically capable or not , whether cooperative and focused on the issue or not and indicate his sense of urgency regarding the case updates. this approach is time efficient , the engineer can easily tick yes/no answers on the compliance sub-tabs questions on case closure , if one customer is receiving non-compliance reports from several the engineers , the accounting team could contact to make him aware of those certain points to work on them
the engineer can easily tick yes/no answers on the compliance sub-tabs questions on case closure to rate the customer's performance , this would enhance the productivity and focus on the issue if the partner working on the SR is well trained and technically capable
