Automatic backup configuration tool - cloud automation plugin
It is a new product.
It is a new market opportunity.
It is a gap in functionality in existing products.
It is aligned with EMC Cloud + 3rd platform vision.
It improves time to service & time to market for backup systems serving Cloud and multilocation environments.
Unified aproach for all cloud stacks and virtualization technologies.
It improves TCE and EMC PS productivity.
Original idea was created by me for a project in ING Bank in Poland last year.
ING required full automation of backup system provisioning with private Cloud Portal.
Private Cloud was based on Hyper-V.
Idea was partially implemented by EMC and local partner (ISCG) with powershell scripts.
Implemented solution was limited to NetWorker backup system and "create", "change", "delete" actions.
My solution is a software or virtual appliance that automates lifecycle of backup configuration.
Software delivers following actions:
- create (backup definition is creataed) - virtual machine is provisioned by Cloud portal
- change (target pool, target device, different cluster, cloning & replication direction) - virtual machine is moved between locations/clusters, protection class is changed
- restore/recover (advanced & optional) -  virtual machine or part of it is restored from backup
- retire (backup definition is deactivated) - virtual machine is decomissioned
- delete (backup definition is deleted, backups are deleted) - retention period of backup data is reached
Software product has 3 intereaces:
- command line interface for scripting
- REST API for external system (cloud orchestrator)
- bulk input interface by CSV, text file
Backup systems that can be covered:
- EMC NetWorker
- EMC Avamar
- Symantec NetBackup
- HP Data Protector
Fully implemented - software product or virtual appliance.
It could make money by providing additional value for Service Providers, Cloud providers, Private/Hybrid Cloud customers.
It would improve TCE by shortening Cloud automation implementation time.
It would save customer money by limiting PS hours necessary.
It would improve TCE by serviceability of software product by EMC as opposed to scripted solution (cumbersome & inflexible scripts).
It would improve PS productivity/margins by allowing PS delivery to implement bulk amounts of backup clients in short time.
