kerberos SSO configuration and troubleshooting tool
This is more relevant to ECD and many business units how are configuring SSO (single sign on) for their products 
In support I used to work with many cases for Documentum product family where SSO issues are time consuming which leads to customer dissatisfaction 
This can be implemented by utility that can analyze what is wrong (in term of configuration ) and at which layer should be corrected ( KDC , Keytabs , Krb5.ini , encryption used , network , client configuration .... etc) as this utility will use certain algorithm following the correct sequence used to troubleshoot the issue . 
Also this utility can be used and embedded in other EMC products as well .
This utility can be used for EMC products and also used by our professional services and support team .
