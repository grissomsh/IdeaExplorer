Effective way of monitoring Air Quality and Urban Traffic
Air Pollution is one of the major threats in EGypt as per current the socio economic scenario. 
Air pollution is one of the major threats in developing economies like India, Egypt. Western nations have some strict measures to tackle & control the levels of air pollution. But we should address them as they are one of caused of global warming.
We can consider few characteristics like Sulphur, NO2,CFCs, Hydro carbons etc. Threshold/permissible levels of these pollutants in air are defined. These parameters can be measured using a sensor network & data can be livefed everyday Cloud-based servers as they have advantageous for their centralisation and scalability in thestorage and processing of data. EMC Isilon has tremendous potential in this segment.

Hadoop can be natively integrated with Isilon to provide robust data analysis. Daily/hourly/weekly trends can be analysed & actions can be taken by govt agencies. Maybe we can have a public display of air pollution levels for general public awareness. 
There is a need for awareness among people in country about air pollution.
