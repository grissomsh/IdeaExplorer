EMC employee exchange program
this idea will help in diversity and greater place to work as it will help all employees that are working in EMC in different countries to share and learn from each other and that will reflect on EMC to be greater place to work.
the idea just came to my mind from the fact of people need to each other in order to expand their skills and learn more.
i have always believed that people learn every day from other people around, and what will help us all as EMC employees is to learn from each other experiences at work and in life as general, i also believe that travelling makes people learn faster and stronger than only hearing from others, my idea is in each business unit in EMC in  all countries will exchange one or two employees each year to different countries and on the other hand it will accept another two employees from another country from the same business unit but from different country, by that way the employees will learn from the other team different skills and ways of working even on the personal level that experience will be reflected on his team and on him self when he come back to his country, same will happen with the others and by that way we will have diversity of employees and it will help EMC to be a great place to work 
since my idea is all about people improvement then it believe that it will in a way or other make a lot of successes, it will improve technology , improve customer satisfaction, and by default that will lead to making and saving money
its all about human resources which i believe is the most important factor in any company speciall EMC
