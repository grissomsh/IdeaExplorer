Re-define EMC II LOGO
In 3rd platform, we may compete with many newly established companies. Compared with them, we're quite a "old" company.
If management team want to change the impression of EMC to customer, to employee, maybe we could start from de-design EMC II logo.
We acquire new companies, produce new products, research new feature. Many thing changed, except for EMC II Logo.
Many other IT companies in the market, like Microsoft and Google, changed their logo many times. We need re-design EMC II logo as well to meet the market needs. This sentence "where information lives" will be removed, only keep "EMC" is enough. And then we need redesign "EMC" with some popular fonts or some colors. After that, from the new logo, customer will see more passion, more energy in EMC.
With a new EMC II logo, we will have new impression to customer, this will help to sale 3rd platform products.
