Raspberry pi robot contest

I have a raspberry pi and found it easy to make some interesting stuffs, and it is easy expanded using GPIO and Arduino expansion board.
EMC can provide some Raspberry Pis, Arduino expansion boards, ultrasonic sensors, color sensors, actuators, and other materials to students, teach them how to assemble a car and program on pi. 
The contest is Raspberry pi robot navigating a maze. 
The robot or car should be able to 
1. Run on a table and not fall down(by programming with ultrasonic sensors)
2. Run through a maze without touching the black line(by programming with color sensors)
3. Find way out as soon as possible
The whole process can last for 2-3 month.
With support from EMC Volunteers, it is not difficult to finish the project.
