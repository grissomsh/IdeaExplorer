Peer To Peer Appreciation 
This will be a new process to implement and will work on encouraging everyone! 
No CST in Cairo has made it to the MVP award and still there are knowledgeable people that help us everyday and can be recognized for their efforts and team spirit. 
A recognition program should be created to recognize our peers that help us everyday. This will be a small scale program unlike the MVP award which will allow us to recognize more colleagues. 

We can have a dashboard on each floor and giveaways that can be given from Peer to peer. 
Will create a great spirit among team members. Peers will be able to recognize and thank each other. Will encourage everyone to help and most importantly, share the knowledge.
