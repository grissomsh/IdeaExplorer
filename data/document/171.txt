Educate customers help reduce the volume of Service Requests opened with Support 
we are offering an E2E plan to reduce the volume of Service requests that new customers open with support in order to get assistance on simple and pending tasks to complete
As I am part of Networker support we are seeing a huge number of Service Requests opened by our new customers. Some are pending problems during the project installation that are left to the customer to deal with and work on fixing it with EMC support employees. Support also receives numerous SRs from new customers to assist in applying new configurations and answer very basic questions
From our install base we can track the number of new accounts emerging in every country/region.In an attempt to help our customers become more knowledgeable about the products they have in their environment, EMC has to conduct regular Product Administration course. Based on the size of each project installed in every country/region , we would be able to forecast the duration of completing installing/implementing the project that would directly affect the frequency of conducting the Product Administration course in the region.Local Account Teams should communicate with EMC delivery specialists to advertise for the coming Product Administration course available and use them to urge customers to attend in order to make the customer capable of managing and controlling their EMC products rather than relying on Support to do the basic needs in environment . Local Account team should regularly urge the customers to attend the course within 1 year of installing their new environment, and this has to be communicated on every new SR the customer opens.
Implementing this idea will help reduce the number of SRs opened with EMC support, to give them space for fixing the more critical issues. That will also help EMC to save resources and reduce the number of employees to be hired in Support teams.
