Rapid Prototyping through Open Source Software Suggestions and Provisioning tool
In IT organizations, the likes of architects, solution designer, are in pressing need to ideate and develop and take their cost-effective solution proof rapidly to the customers. Often an idea nurtured cannot be prototyped quickly owing to lack of knowledge of technologies, poor selections and implementation challenges. This can lead to reduction in earning potential or loosing edge over competitors even if there is a compelling idea to sell.
This idea occurred to me while introspecting the challenge "Russia COE Open Source Challenge" and the challenges IT organizations are facing to keep abreast of newer technologies ,innovate and take their ideas to the market in a fast paced disruptive innovation world
Solution: An online tool which can capture information on various Open source softwares, tag them, categorize them , provide reports or comparative analysis of related softwares and automatically provision the selected software(s) required to achieve the solution into one or more VMs. Images of well-known open source softwares can be prepared in advance and can be configured in this tool to be used later for deployments. Researchers can feed the new found open source software information into the tool which can be rated or there can be online source of such information from which this tool can fetch information about the softwares.
Target customers for such product could be any IT organizations aspiring to reduce time-to-market for building innovative solutions which involve evaluating software alternatives (here Open Source Softwares only) and building a POC.
