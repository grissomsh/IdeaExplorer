 Random Wall of Fame â€“ encourage employees engagement 

 The idea came up from different KPIs related awards like CSAT awards and MVP awards.


  
The idea is as simple as having a Random Wall of Fame at the COE. This wall of fame will be used to recognize the positive contribution in different activities. Trophy awards can be given to :
-	top achievements : having best contribution in certain activity
-	diverse participation: participating in many different activities.
-	Success stories : examples to follow from previous participants
This will help encourage employees participate more in different activities like : sports tournaments, charity activities .. etc

This approach is effective in the functional work and KPIs and can be reflected to cover the activities as well.
