"Software Defined Power" Service Layer for ViPR 
The software defined data center ignores the main cause of most important resource usage in the data center which is power. The sponsors call for massive efficiency gain in EMC product energy usage in the data center can be addressed only by decoupling workloads from the data center power infrastructure. Perhaps the time has come for analytical and more proactive thinking about power management in the software defined data center. Software defined power can improve power efficiency by collecting, synthesizing and analyzing energy data from (particularly EMC storage / converged infra) to improve capacity, performance and utilization. In turn providing resource consumption planning allowing demand planning. Also supporting dynamic workload redistribution.
We had worked on few energy efficiency related projects before like "Data Center Robot for environmental monitoring" / "Power chargeback system for vBlock" and this idea is the logical evolution. The proposed idea is a closed loop application while the previous ideas leaves the decision to human users. With the software defined power, automation will bring in tremendous efficiency 
Our idea brings in a fresh approach of decoupling applications from power infrastructure. ViPR abstraction can make this approach possible as control & data pane is decoupled. Our solution gives triggers & commands through control pane with external agent to start with. As most outages are power related, this approach will improve reliability while improving efficiency using dynamic redistribution

If the idea is successfully implemented, we will demonstrate exponential energy efficiency gains in the data center using EMC stack. It is a logical extension to the EMC product strategy which brings in better TCO to customers. Also the idea leverages the power of data for dynamic optimization of power usage.
