EMC nap pods

I came up with this idea because in so many days, I found out that me and my colleagues are tired and want to have a small nap or a rest to be able to begin or continue doing our daily work.  
In each floor, two or more nap pods should be available in order to provide employees the chance to have a five to fifteen power naps in order to be able to get back to work in a good state.
