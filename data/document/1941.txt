EMC COEs as a "KT Center" 
Facing some period of time without any billable projects or your team feeling bored with doing same tasks over and over or from doing trainings for long times. Well, with this program your team will start sharing their gained knowledge and field experiences in a productive way by start utilizing them to delivery KT sessions (live and recorded) to our customers. 
It's my genuine idea. 
By developing a KT - knowledge Transfer - contents, which will be delivered either thru online streams or as a recorded sessions.  

The contents will be based on the listen and react model, we will survey our customers and partners about the topics that they want to hear from us and afterward we will deliver the sessions to their interest, after a while we will have a library that allows our target audiences to select from. 
In this approach, we will help on the other hand to build the awareness to our sales force about our customer interest in the new systems that they might be interested to buy and build a strong pipelines.


- stretch the COE offices reach to more customers and partners that will open the door for opening more business with them.
- Generate more demand for projects similar to what they asked for.
- Get the ICs more busy in an efficient way with good time utilization by developing and recording their skills and experiences.
- Overcome the non-peak periods where no scored utilization.
