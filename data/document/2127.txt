Crowd Sourcing: an opportunity to bring cultural heritage and employees closer together

A remarkable consensus exists among the general public with respect to the way they view their history and cultural inheritance as a common asset, as something that belongs to them, and which they feel it is their responsibility to explain it to the people from different cultures as well as to pass on the new joiner's.
Whenever any employee visits other COE's it's become challenging on how to initiate a conversation and build a good relationship with them due to lack of knowledge about the cultural background.
Application of cultural crowdsourcing in an approach based on the collaboration that users perform:

Correction and Transcription - Inviting users to correct and/or transcribe outputs of digitization processes
Contextualisation - Adding contextual knowledge to objects, e.g. by telling stories
or writing articles/wiki pages with contextual data
Complementing Collection - Active pursuit of additional objects to be included in a (Web)
exhibit or collection aims to create a huge collaborative database of audio snippets, samples, recordings and bleep
Classification - Gathering descriptive metadata related to object in a collection.
Social tagging is a well-known example.
Co-curation - Using inspiration/expertise of non-professional curators to create (Web)exhibits
Crowdfunding - Collective cooperation of people who pool their money and other resources together to support efforts initiated by others
Active involvement of employees in the enrichment of the cultural heritage and the way in which the links between active users and heritage have been strengthened.
