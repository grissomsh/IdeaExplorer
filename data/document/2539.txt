Storage aware containers
Provide unmatched storage performance using XtremIO AFA for Cloud containters
Played with it in the lab.
I suggest using storage-side snapshots (specifically, XtremIO's) which are much more efficient and provide all the benefits that thin-dm provides.

See Comprehensive Overview of Storage Scalability in Docker | Red Hat Developer Blog for some information and about the prevalence and importance of containers - Red Hat Launches Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Atomic Host, Advances Linux Containers in the Enterprise | Red Hat

 

If anyone wants to play with Docker containers without the above (see how ugly it is to set it up, even though I'm setting it on XtremIO devices):

 

dmsetup create docker-pool --table "0 209715200 thin-pool /dev/mapper/3514f0c5531e00007 /dev/mapper/3514f0c5531e00006 512 8192"

dmsetup message /dev/mapper/docker-pool 0 "create_thin 0"

dmsetup create thin --table "0 20971520 thin /dev/mapper/docker-pool 0"

rm -rf /var/lib/docker/*

mkdir -p /var/lib/docker/devicemapper/devicemapper/

ln -s /dev/mapper/docker-pool /var/lib/docker/devicemapper/devicemapper/data

service docker start

docker pull centos

docker run centos:centos6 yum â€“y update

Much higher performance gained with the above over other methods I've tried (/var/lib/docker on top of either EXT4 or XFS)
