Encourage go-green by distributing plants.

We celebrate environment day every year at work place but we are not contributing to environment. This idea is on the same grounds. I went back home and thought that the true of meaning of contributing to environment is only when we actually do something.
Distribute small plants to employees whoever is interested at least twice an year and encourage them to plant at home.

Encourage employees to educate their family and children how planting improves environmental health.
