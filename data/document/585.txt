EMC's Seminars At Schools
This will serve the challenge/s listed below. 
I personally know several young students who would love to learn more from the IT leaders in order to see how they want to be part of it!? If IT is the path for them..? 
Create regular seminars in schools all over the country aiming at explaining where the IT industry is going and several terminologies that are in the market today! such as Big Data..etc.

EMC volunteers would lead seminars all over targeting young individuals who are interested in IT. This will help them shape their ideas about the market and take the right decision when it comes to collage. 
Young students will be aware of what is going on in such a vital industry
Take accurate collage decisions 
Spread the word 
Create a better society 
Expand their minds and knowledge
