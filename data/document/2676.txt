Reporting and Analytics through real-text input
The Office of the CTO 'New Business' Challenge was to come up with new ideas that leverage existing EMC technology and expand EMCs reach into new markets.  This idea enters the data visualization and analytics space, leveraging on EMCs Big data platform.
I first came up with this idea when reading a Fantasy Football summary on Yahoo Fantasy Sports a few years ago.  The summary was a well written commentary of the "play-by-play" of my fantasy football teams performance.  It was non-human written but almost convincing.  This is the first time I have shared the idea.
My solution is a free-text analytics and visualization engine.  Imagine a simple search box where you could type “Number of X over time compared to number of Y” and have the engine translate your text into a data query and return you a result, ask you for some more information, or ask you how you want to see your data.  Of all data visualization tools on the market, none of them let you ask questions in your language, they all make you learn theirs.  I am not aware of any business investigating this space.  It is an enormous opportunity to provide value in a very active and popular field.  In a way, it is providing AI analytics and visualization on top of Big Data.
Success = A CFO typing "past 3 months of sales compared with gross margin" into a simple web page search box and getting a nice graph in return.  Benefit to EMC = potential additional market share in a $125B market that is growing at ~9% per year.
