All Hands Room
Improve the communication between business unites and federation partners in multiples sites.
To build the team unity and communication between business unites and federation partners, increase the awareness and people engagement to participate in activity with unknown members to them in the COE, and initiate the idea of Working together.
My idea simply is to have an “All hands room” in this room should be a modern desks with docking stations, vending machine, coffee machine, speakers to listen to music, LCD to display the new activity of the COE that will be coming soon.  
 and give the chance for any one from any BU to go and work from there, managers should encourage peoples to do so.
-	Teams that working on night shifts can use it, good chance to share experiences.
