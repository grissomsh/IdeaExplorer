Market place for Organic farming by households and small farmers in Smart Cities.
This idea will generate data related to agriculture products grown by small scales farmers. 
1. Data will be used for various analytics including availablity, compatitive rates, forcaste, etc
2. It solves the problem of Smart Cities in terms of availability of home grown vegetables and fruits without the need of importing from other states or countries.
We grow vegetables in our terrace gardens and face this challenge of excess produce. Hence we decided to work on a solution that can be implemented at a city/state level and can address the vegetable/food shortage problem.
We create an App/Website as a market place wherein each household/farmer can upload the availability of their excess produce. Similarly any person in that neighbourhood can locate the nearby seller of organic produce and can buy directly from his neighbour. This will give better price to the producer and will eliminate the middlemen.
Data generated from each neighborhood can be collected in the central system at the city level and the data from the City level can be sent to State level.
Based on the Data collected, the Data Mining and Analytics can be performed. This can help in forcasting the future produce and the city/state requirements.

EMC can make this App and offer the data warehousing, data mining and Analytics services to Smart cities and thereby have a share of revenue so generated by these offerings.
