EMC Part Tracking
-Enhancing the process of part replacement or ordering in each department.
-Enhancing supply chain for new sold products.
In CS, We always get new calls from customers inquiring about parts being shipped to them or complaining about having the wrong part shipped.
Having a tool/application to let customers track the parts to make it easier for them to get the information they want such as: ETA, Destination and Attention information.
If tool is being used by customers or EMC departements, They will be saving a lot of time and effort to track parts, add comments or to increase priority of shipment.

Not only this but also Workflow managers won't need to allocate available TSEs to work
