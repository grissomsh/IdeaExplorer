NCC reminder application.
I got this idea in my mind by thinking about the NCC that sometimes get missed by TSE when he/she is busy due to more work.

My company always belived in accurate results, hence missing a single NCC may also upset the customer that we are dealing with.




We sometime misses NCC when we have to much of work on our shoulders. 

As we always focus to satisfy every single customer we need to set our actions on time.

There are multiple custmomer whom we deal with however it is not predicted that we spend X amount of time on a single customer, there is a time when we spend more time on one customer and misses to follow the other on time.
 
Reminder helps us in prior planning of the work.

Reminder about the NCC helps TSE to take a required action on time.

Contacting customer at a promised time is one of the major ethic of customer handling.

Satisfying the customer built a company's repution.
Satisfying the customer is a big success for every customer support representative.

This will be a success of the team as well as it shows our concern towards the customer's satisfaction.
