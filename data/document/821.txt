direct all traffic to secure server
adding a layer for security for non native secure devices
working with many types of encryption algorithm
the server will assign a token for each registered device (cookie )
the server will act as proxy
it will challenge each device with its native communication 
instead of the devices communicate directly with each other,
will add this layer of security so that all the traffic will go directly to the server
it will open a new opportunity to add this layer of securtiy
