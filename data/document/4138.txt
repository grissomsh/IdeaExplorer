End to End Performance Troubleshooting Tool

Performance issues are the most common one for every environment. If we have a tool then things will be real easy to trouble shoot issues.
Performance issues are the most common issues of all in almost every environment. We need a common tool which gives an interactive mapping diagram with io statistics/bandwidth (read/ write/ response  
time/utilization...)  that can help us easily identify bottle necks in the least possible time. The input/feeders for this tool can be the host ports, fabric ports and Array ports. This new tool should be built considering the below scenarios so that it even works for these cases.
- Switch Port virtualization (NPIV).
- Array Virtualization (VPLEX and so on)
- ISL Links (ISL/Trunk)
