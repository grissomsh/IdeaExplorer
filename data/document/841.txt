EMC's extended support for non premium customers
Non Premium customers can go on with their business of data protection without having to wait for EMC support to arrive. Though this is a temporary solution, this will help the customers to backup their data during multiple disks failures.
This is just a thought keeping customer service in mind.
EMC must support these customers by providing a temporary solution that does not 
hamper their data protection and helps in continuing data protection without downtime on a temporary basis.

It would be good for EMC to -
Provide validation on thrid party HDD that the customer can use for the moment. 
A provision to validate these Hard disk drives and certify for temporary usage until 
EMC support team arrives for a node or disk replacement.
EMC can allow/unlock a special package from the download center, that the customer 
will use it against the HDD, run the software on the HDD and certify the disk to be 
used temporarily.
The third party HDD will be marked in the probe.xml files and other Avamar config 
files with a dereferencing flag indicating that this drive must be replaced with EMC 
HDD
There can also be some other security features enabled on these drives until replacement.
Special reports can be generated indicating both EMC and the client for disk/disk's replacement.
EMC and Non-premium customers are both benefited. Customers need not have to wait till the support arrives
