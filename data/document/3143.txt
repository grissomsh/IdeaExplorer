Mind Refreshing Games inside GCC

Many time after completing shift we will go and play Table Tennis, that time i will keep telling my team mates that if we have some games inside GCC that will be good, so that when ever we find some free time we can go and play.
(Indoor games like carrom, chess so on)
If we have few indoor games inside GCC,so that people can go play, relax and get back to there work with fresh energy filled mind.
Instead of taking Coffee or Tea or other junks i feel this is the better way to energise your mind.
