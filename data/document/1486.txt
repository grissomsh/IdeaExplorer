Cross BU collaboration
Now that we have all resources/employees trained in almost all the products specific to each technology(Storage/Backup) we may have to elicit maximum throughput from them, which would in turn help people to keep the learnt things intact.
Engineers have to have dedicated time to work with other products for two weeks in a quarter, eventually it helps them understand the product better.
I have alone come across such an incident and it has passed it's incubation period too
This helps engineers to have a broader sense towards the technology and helps them improve the trouble shooting speed.
Time=Money ; I would certainly say that it saves a lot of time.
