Provide Big Data service to customers
Even costumers themselves don't know how they can leverage the Big Data service, which mean no demands, no profit. we need to help customers to create the demands.
For now, even Big Data exists for years, we don't have much impressive business models or products. I think a more ideas and tries on this topic is good for us because we are entering the DT age.
Use our advantage, such as visualization, cloud computing etc to create the expandable Big Data environment to customers, which have had Hadoop or Spark environment configured.
Customer could buy or rent this service and pay the money based on the number of computing nodes(VMs) they requested. 
This idea could be enhanced to be a business model, create a new market demands and result in more margin. also it leverage the strength of EMC.
