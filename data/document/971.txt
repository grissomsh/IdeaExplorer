Take test case design more more seriously
Ensure the product quality with better designed test cases
Found it's not easy to draw a valid set of test cases from existing test cases in recent test planning work
Need more efforts on test case design phase which is the base of execution and implementation, we can achieve this by:
- clean up the existing test cases by removing those duplicated, empty content, out of date;
- align the folders structure in UTMS;
- build field knowledge in depth, study existing cases, determine the coverage;
- assign priority attribute to test cases for easy planning;
- revisit existing test cases regularly for maintenance by adding new case, add new test data, removing invalid cases; 
- study on issues from customer side, investigate the failures and seek possibility to add cases in test process;
It's an action with poor visible output in short time, but doing this can gain more confidence from our customer by providing higher quality product
