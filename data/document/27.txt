6 months trails
We will get the best out of each employee and we will maintain the diversity in each department
When people apply for a job with knowing their roles in it theoritcally but have never tried this kind of job before, that might lead to the disappointment of the employee if he figured out that he doesn't like this kind of job after being stuck in.
after accepting any EMC employee he will rotate in every department at emc he will stay there about a whole month trying to get to know about each department and the type of work in each one , the job descriprion and his role in each department ; after that they will choose the best department that suits his qualifications and his criteria .
Everyone would be in the best place for him that suits him and that will increase the satisfaction of every employee as he will experience most of the positions in the COE before deciding inw hat position to end up.
