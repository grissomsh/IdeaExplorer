Diversifying the hiring process
My idea aims to : 
* Bring in more innovative ideas by diversifying the EMC population.
* The more diverse the population the higher chances of finding multiple and better solutions to one problem.
* Increase employee adaptability towards diversity.
I came up with the idea after interacting with few of the colleagues and teams. Since my daily work involves contacting number of employees, I always get to hear how the ratio was mismatched when it came to diversity.
My solution is simple and feasible - 
EMC needs to start having Campus recruitment drives at Girls only colleges and Institutes for the differently abled. These are the sources for getting diverse population in terms of talent and out of the box thinking. Also you could mold this candidates to meet EMC standards. 
This program is different from the GSAP since in GSAP only candidates from regular schools are considered.
Having recruitment drives in Girls only colleges and Institutes for the differently abled means getting a right mixture of diversity.
  
If my idea was implemented and taken in the right direction we would be able to bridge the gap in the diversity differences in office.
It will improve customer familiarity and satisfaction.
Due to diversity in the population at EMC we will be able to cater to a wider audience and this would also mean getting better ratings at customer satisfaction surveys. 
Diverse population means better team work, more ideas, innovative collaborations and many more benefits.
