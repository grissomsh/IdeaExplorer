XtremIO Elasticity Through Multi-Size X-Bricks
Customer’s capacity requirements are increasing dynamically, but, XtremIO being one of the robust AFA in the market is not flexible enough to scale. Once they buy an X-Brick of certain type, the architecture allows it to expand using only the same X-Brick
During our brainstorming and research, we found most of the XtremIO competitors offer dynamic expansion to accommodate the varying capacity needs of the customer.
XtremIO should allow mixing of different sized X-Bricks – a single cluster should allow mixing of 10TB, 20TB and 40TB. This feature enables the customers to buy and add different types of X-Bricks according to their requirements, as the data grows. XtremIO architecture does not have any constraint in adding this feature.

To achieve this, Fingerprint space for each SC should be weighed according to the size of the X-Brick:

In a homogeneous cluster, data is distributed among all X-Bricks using consistent distributed mapping; this is done by dividing the fingerprint/hash address space equally among all the Storage Controllers. 
In a cluster with different X-Bricks the physical capacity of each X-Brick is different, and therefore fingerprint address space has to be distributed in a way that is proportional to the physical capacity of the X-Brick.

How is this achieved? 
Each Storage Controller (SC) will be assigned weightage based on the type of X-Brick
10TB X-Brick SC – 1
20TB X-Brick SC – 2
40TB X-Brick SC – 4
Fingerprint Space % for a SC = (Weight of the SC)/ (Sum of weights of all SCs)*100

With this idea, different X-Brick types can coexist in the same cluster with the fingerprint space mapped proportionally across the different X-Bricks. This in turn enables even distribution of data among all the X-Bricks. No single X-Brick or drive is ov
