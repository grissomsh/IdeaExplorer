Tile based Puzzle with EMC Products.

This idea came from a game which involved arranging pipes to carry water and can easily be adapted to show EMC branding and Technologies.
The basis of this puzzle is a 4x4 grid of tiles, at the top of the grid are your data sources and at the bottom of the grid are your EMC Data Storage Devices. The player is provided with a selection of tiles with wiring patterns on them. The concept is to arrange these tiles within a certain timelimit so that the Data Sources are linked to EMC Data Storage before the time has expired. Advanced levels can have bigger Data Sources and Data Storage Devices (e.g. VMAX) or the cable pattern on the tiles can be different types of medium e.g. iSci/Fibre so only the correct pattern of arranged tiles will allow the Data to flow from the Data sources to the EMC Storage allowing the player to progress to the next level. Players can advance their career/level from a beginner level (small company with few users/data sources, simple solution) through to the highest level (an EMC solution architect, providing solutions for multinational companies) with more complex puzzles involving varied Data Storage devices with particular cabling requirements on larger grids. This puzzle coul dbe made available online through a website or in an App for a tablet or smartphone.
