Environmental Stewardship Challenge
Hope it will help with developing a solution that increases the energy efficiency of an EMC product by more than 60% by 2020.

We can use Solar cells to generate our energy. According to the latest updates, that Solar energy using solar cells can reduce up to 60% or 70% of our current usage (Electricity using generators, or the normal input/output current), especially in COE Egypt as we have perfect weather to generate and use maybe 75% of our energy from our Sun

we can also encourage people to decrease their usage of energy and we can encourage them by inventing some activities to generate power using kinetic energy like "Bicycling" to use them directly to the generators
