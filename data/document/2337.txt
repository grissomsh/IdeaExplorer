Linking site ID to a specific email address for all products
na
This idea triggered as we have multiple products and we could have one common point to send in the email asking for feedback from the customer.
This idea would ease out of providing feedback by customer to EMC. Instead of sending emails to different email address for a feedback survey. EMC can send emails to one single email address.
