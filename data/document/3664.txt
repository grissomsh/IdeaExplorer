Who owns my cloud?

We have faced this issue in Vodafone public cloud deployment by EMC consulting and trying to build this fraework in a way that it can be reused. We are close to winning few more cloud deals in Etisalat,Yasraf, T systems etc and every where it is a common problem. Customer is confident EMC can build cloud but still they are at times going to other partners since they can maintain the cloud better. Who owns my cloud in private and hybrid cloud is a question all customers are asking and EMC ought to have that answer with a solution of root causing in place for cloud environment.
Create a automation work flow to identify the source of the problem. Example in Vodafone public cloud built by EMC, we have RSA solution for authentication and authorisation, Cloud portal from iQuest, Webhosting ,share point and exchange from EMC solutions, VMWare ESX , emc and EMC and Non EMC arrays. This is an end to end cloud solutions built by EMC. However post UAT ,maintenance is nightmare because it is difficult to root cause in case of any problem(example exchange provisioing) because of multiple party ,product involvement and every vendor/product looks at it as a point solution. The automation solution work flow will analyze log from different sources and coorelate to automatically find out the source of the problem. This will improve Time to relief and Time to resolution and Total customer experience.
