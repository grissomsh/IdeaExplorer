Spot award for getting Surveys and CSAT's that contributes towards team.

The customer support engineers receive a lot of customer support e-mails and the management recognizes the engineers by congratulating and appreciating them. 
There were instances where customers offered gifts to the engineers as a token of appreciation, but as per EMC policies we are not allowed to accept gifts from customers.

So why not the management or the BU reward the engineers with such gifts.
We do currently have a reward system in place when engineers receive CSATs in the form of 'Surveys', but majority of the CSATs we get, are in the form of customer appreciation e-mails.

So spot awards like an Amazon gift card of 15$ or a Flipkart.com gift voucher of 500 INR could be given to the engineers in recognition of the Exemplary support provided to the customer.
