Noise Cancelling
Noise in the work area creates distractions.
My office was based in a very noisy part of the manufacturing floor until recently.  I used a headset to remove some of the noise and interruptions associated with this noise.  Using the headset sparked this idea,  
Wireless noise cancelling headphones:

Linked to the following:
PA
Alarms
Work & personal phone
PC

Additional features:
Microphone to make calls
Voice to text functionality - for writing emails etc.. 
Voice commands similar to Siri found on Iphones
Less distractions make employees more efficient.

Would improve efficiency in the following areas:
Writing emails.
Creating power point slides.
Accessing files/documents
