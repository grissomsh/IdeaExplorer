(LOST AUTHOR) TCE - Make Software Upgrades Easier
The idea is to improve the TCE.
Work Experience
The proposal : 

Have both SMS and director upgrade fils (*.tar) in a single package and build the enviroment such that the user/customer is allowed to upgrade all at once. The customer should be able to get their SMS's / directors at single shot. The procedure might be some thing like this:

Let's say the build is now available <VPlex-5.5.0.0.5.tar> .The user will execute the command like, 

VPlex-Cluster-Upgrade --upgrade-both /tmp/VPlexInstallPackages/VPlex-5.5.0.0.5 from any of the clustered site. 

This should first upgrade the local SMS and then upgrade the remote SMS and then proceed with the director upgrade. The user/customer does not have to spend lot of time copying the files to the remote system for SMS upgrade and doing NDU pre-check etc., 

As part of the command that was executed by the customeer, all other proceedings should be made automated.


This is improve the TCE and make customer feel happy and happy customers means more profit.
