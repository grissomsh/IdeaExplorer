Elastic Cloud Capacity Modeling

We had similar challange in EMC IT. We are devlopeing an automated process and working with business to implement a solution that will save several millions of dollars for EMC. 
If the resource utilization stays below 10% for more than 6 months, automatically trigger a job that will reclaim the resources. If the resource utilization goes above 60%, expand capacity automatically and monitor closely.  The monitroing solution (eg. VCOPS from VMware) will contiously track and trigger the job depending on the threshold. 

EVP Opportunity:
Develop an integrated product leveraging solutions from EMC, VMware and Pivotal that can proactively monitor and scale up or down the resource allocation becaused on utilization. 
1)EMC can provide the solution for storaege resources and VMware can leverage or improve the current toolset to resolve compute and network resource under utlization. 
2)Pivotal can build an analytics aolution for the historical analysis of monitoring data for these 3 resources and present executive utilization dashboard for leadership team.
