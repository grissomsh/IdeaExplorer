Resolution through Videos

A way of enhancing issue resolution
Instead of KB articles that provide troubleshhoting steps for issue reolution, we can develop videos for the same purpose.

If we leverage videos to resolve customer's issue, it will be way better and will allow customers to better understand the break/fix issues. Knowing through seeing and observing is better than just reading things that customers might not know well about them.
