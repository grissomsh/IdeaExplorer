Refresh SAP system by AppSync 

AppSync can protect oracle/SQL, but it can not protect SAP directly.
I started to test the scenario 2 months ago. now the problem is how to umount the previous copy created by the AppSync automatically. 
SAP protecting/refreshing can be worked by Appsync directly.
it will be a new solution between Appsync and SAP
