Single-sign on app that encourages users to contribute quality ideas from cultures and EMC locations around the world. This is accomplished via tagging of contributions, which makes it easier for contributors to see others’ similar content and feel more of a compelling reason to continue submitting, and with high-quality content. This foundation also allows for further encouragement, including a social feed, gamification using points, and sponsored challenges for specific types of cultural content with the possibility of monetary incentives.

Screens
1.	Idea screen
•	Accessible via Search screen (#2), Browse Ideas screen (#4) and Feed screen (#10).
•	Each submitted Idea has associated with it: its submitter, number of Likes it has received, Tags associated with it, which Challenges it had been submitted to, and Comment/additional content (images, attachments, etc) included when the Idea was uploaded.
•	Users who did not submit the Idea can suggest additional tags, for approval by the user who originally submitted it.
•	The user who did submit the Idea can edit their idea and add attachments by clicking edit on this screen, taking them to the Upload/Edit Idea screen (#9).

o	  List of all Challenges.
?	    This view by default is ordered by the date of the Challenge deadline, or can be ordered alphabetically, or by number of Ideas submitted to that Challenge.

•	Uses "properties" files and labels to define different phrases for each language
Like the Innovation Challenge, Business Unit Owners would typically be the level of EMC employee interested in starting a Challenge, to solve a problem or brainstorm ideas from a diversity of EMC employees around the world.

The net for ideas is significantly widened by:
1.	Allowing any manager to open a Challenge. This represents a big difference compared to the existing Innovation Challenges.
2.	Managers can open as many Challenges as they want. This represents a big difference compared to the existing Innovation Challenges.
3.	Challenges can be opened at any point during the year. This represents a big difference compared to the existing Innovation Challenges.
4.	Challenge sponsors can determine their own prizes, whether point-based or monetary.
5.	Employees are encouraged to submit their own ideas regardless of whether it fits into an existing Challenge. Linking their idea to a Challenge can be done at any later point, and to arbitrarily many Challenges. This represents a big difference compared to the existing Innovation Challenges.
6.	Employees would see a feed (like a Facebook social newsfeed) of ideas prioritized by those matching the Tags they tend to submit to and thus be interested in.
7.	Employees would be further enticed to comment on others’ ideas because it’s a social app with gamification (points and likes).
8.	Employees would be further encouraged to add to already good ideas because the best ideas would typically filter to the top of their feed and of challenges.
9.	The tagging system also improves order.
