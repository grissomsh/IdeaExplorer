 Smart Collaboration using a “Draw it” Dashboard shared between TSEs for effective collaboration

 The idea comes to my head each time I use “share screen” to show any technical design or something to my colleages. I thought about having such “draw it” service
 The idea works as follows :
-	Add the shared drawing dashboard feature to the Office Communicator (OC).
-	When two employees are collaborating with each other, they will use this dashboard to draw drafts about the environment structure and setup.
-	The dashboard can also be integrated with webex to enable visual communication with the customer and a higher TCE and CSAT.
