One seed will help the Environment 



A friend of mine has a plant on her desk. It decorates and makes everything look prettier. It also help change her attitude towards picking a flower off a tree or destroying plants on the ground by stepping on them.


Each employee plants one seed in a pot on their desk. They will have to take care of it and try to nourish it. When they see how it starts to grow and become bigger they will appreciate the greener already planted all around.
