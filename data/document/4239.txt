EMC education and investments in global startups

EMC has acquired many companies and also is the trend in the market, instead of investing in ground up projects, acquire company which has done work in the same field which also holds a lot of investment. 
instead invest in the startup projects and if the potential is been identified, acquire the startup company.
The investment would be negligible initially because it would only need some time from the college goers to invest sometime if they get a chance to do a startup company with an idea or solution for an existing problem or any future problems which may arise.

find out small startup companies who are working towards 3rd platforms or M2M learning, or IOT, or BYOD thoughts.

all the startup companies would get a chance to get funded if they prove out a solution which is a potential problem solver in the market.
