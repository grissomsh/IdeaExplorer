Creating Business Opportunities for EMC - Delivering unique services and functions. 

From current similar engagements we have with  several countries in EMEA and is very successful. 
India COE has the above mentioned expertise in these skill areas and is instrumental in delivering some of the key large scale projects in EMEA region.
 
The delivery model that has been chalked out is two ways whichever suits the country we are working with. 
First , 20 to 30% of the staff on the project are from the onsite team where customer interactions are dealt with and the rest work 60 to 70% is done remotely.  Once the customer gets used to the remote mode, more work can be done remotely.

This helps in two ways : Project costs come down while maintaining quality and more competitive pricing can be provided to the customer. Opens up new revenue generation options for EMC.

2nd model, Entire staff is remote , if the customer is fine with remote work.This model is working successfully for the Americas region.  There is a Project manager onsite facing the customer being the face of EMC. 

This again brings down cost substantially not comprising on the quality of work.
