 ‘Report It’ Photo Cloud - Smart City Crowd-Sourced Issue Reporting
 
The idea defines a solution providing the smart city with a direct link over the cloud allowing citizens to report issues and violations to authorities in real time. 

 The idea came up from noticing the ineffectiveness of the social media approach for such issues
 
The solution is as simple as a mobile app connected to a cloud platform to upload captured photos. Some features will exist like :

1-	Access privacy: by authenticating users and defining multiple scopes inside this cloud (transportation authority, security..etc)
2-	Auto alert to responsible authorities such as policemen through the mobile app at their side
3-	GPS data encapsulation with the photo: to route reported incidents to the nearby authorities.

EMC can provide the enabling technology for this solution and provide Pivotal CF for App development.

1-	More reliable approach than social media
2-	Higher security and efficient incident management
3-	Potential for EMC in smart city market
