Approval Time Limits for Change Requests
This will directly result in reduced product change cycle times, which reduces fulfillment time, better positions EMC to compete faster in platform3 environments, drives costs out of operations and advances design and process performance.
Ongoing frustration that CRs take longer than seems reasonable to me, and have an unpredictable cycle time, sometimes 3+ weeks. I’ve been thinking how we can get EMC to NOT wallow in bureaucracy so that we can compete in platform3 with small, lean start-ups.
Enforce a time limit for corporate approval of CRs in SAP - if a CR Approver has not actioned an approval task after 5 days (or some other reasonable time), automatically indicate CR approval for that Approver. Automate this new “presumptive approval” so that CRs are not subject to a “pocket veto” as they now are. Currently the CR Originator must chase Approvers to understand why an approval task is incomplete. The burden of proof should be reversed to force the Approver to articulate an objection to a CR within a set leadtime so that the objection can be addressed and the change processed. Alternately, or perhaps in concert with this new policy, escalate approval tasks to Approver’s Supervisor/Manager after 3 days (or some other reasonable time), and then to that Supervisor’s/Manager’s Manager after 2 days and finally automatically indicate approval by the Manager at the 5 day time limit unless the Approver/Manager articulates a bona fide objection to a CR.
A predictable and short approval cycle time for Change Requests. A new approval task status/authority in SAP that can be flipped on after 5 business days on any un-actioned approval tasks. A new approval task status in SAP for Approver to articulate speci
