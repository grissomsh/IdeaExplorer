Storage Energy Efficiency and Effectiveness
Not all storage systems consume the same amount of power or deliver the same performance with the same number of ports, controllers, cache, and disk drives. A challenge with storage systems is gauging power consumption and performance. For example, can system A use less power than system B while system A delivers the same level of performance (is it as fast), amount of capacity, or space to store data (how useful)? It is possible to create a storage system that uses less power, but if the performance is also lower than with a competing product, multiple copies of the lower-power-consuming system may be needed to deliver a given level of performance.
Usually EMC estimate the power consumption for its products through the " EMC Power calculator" http://powercalculator.emc.com/Main.aspx. Which I consider not too accurate due to lack of operating conditions and configurations. 

Employ our powerful EMC analytics to collect information about the operating conditions, configurations, write errors, ...etc. to a dedicated cloud hosted by EMC to make our researches and suggest new best practices based on real data gathered from the "in production" storage arrays. 
By having accurate information we can gain the next

1- Reduced power consumed by our products.
2- Effectiveness of EMC products Vs competitors' ones.
3- Lower TCO for EMC products.
4- Increased TCE.
