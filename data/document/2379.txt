Reducing the number of customer contacts
Reducing the number of customer contacts
When I bought HP printer for my home. It was amazing with experience of it setup workflow 

Proposal is in similar line. 

At every Unisphere page; have a link to EMC support link, Self-learning Clip or Document. 

Also add Customer Details page at Unisphere which gets collected as a part of SYR data.

Depending upon the platinum/Diamond customer get the link to chat or call.

Also the Unisphere page shall show what all features Customer can have if not opted for or has bought license. 

Details
Ex: 
   File system page shall show the protection features can be enabled. EMC link to start engaging those.
Unisphere page shall have a support link/ Document link for how to use the feature. 

This will improve customer experience and provide confidence. 

EMC can make/save money by providing these services.
