Different lunch vendors in ICOE A & B block.
This will add few points for EMC as a Great Place to Work.
While trying to explore to the other cafeteria and sees the same food available there for lunch, this comes as a suggestion from most of us.
ICOE has 2 cafeterias then why not have two different vendors for lunch / dinner. This will increase the food options available to the employees.
Gives more options to the employees, thus increasing their satisfaction.
