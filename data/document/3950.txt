Eliminate or significantly reduce amount of Failure Analysis on Lower value Part Number FRMs

The Global FRM team have recently reviewed the processing costs taking into account the dollar value of HW actually being tested. We found that the labour cost for some part numbers was actually double or treble the value of the HW. there are many consideration to take into account here. some parts are needed for planning demand and despite being a loss making prospect; just have to be processed. The cost of processing varies significantly depending on the product type. We have the ability to categorise our processing of Field returns from a financial point of view then compare this to planning demand and mission critical failure analysis. Without any point of view being compromised considerable savings should be realised.
Recent incentives have shown that costs for failure analysis on some part numbers are higher than the value of the part! Failure analysis on under performing products in the field is MISSION CRITICAL and needs to be done to ensure quality: for PN's this is absolutely necessary a representative sample should have FA carried out; this serves as damage limitation on the FA we know we are going to make a loss on. PN's (DIMMs IO Modules etc.)whose value is very close to the cost of processing should immediately be reviewed.
