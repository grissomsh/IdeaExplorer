Scannable authentication for wireless working, conferencing and presenting
My idea addresses the challenge because it streamlines in-house wireless connectivity, and adds a "wow-factor" to our innovative work environment.
I came up with the idea when thinking about how annoying it is to have to connect with a token when I am at EMC other sites than my own. Firstly, I have to remember to have the RSA token handy. Secondly, I have to remember the correct login procedure, which is different to the procedure for connecting remotely. A few times, I've been locked out of the network when using the incorrect login procedure.
Each room would be equipped with some sort of biometric and/or QR scanner. Each employee will have to initially either enroll with biometric data of some kind, or will be supplied with a unique QR code, which will be saved on a password-protected smartphone, laptop, or other personal mobile device. The code could be fixed, or dynamically generated. When the employee wants to connect wirelessly to the corporate network, she will have to present the QR code or biometric info to the scanner. If it is authenticated successfully, that device will gain access to the network, including the ability to connect wirelessly to shared equipment in the room or vacinity. Appropriate network access permissions for each user will be enforced. Non-EMC visitors will be given a single-use QR code for use during their visit to EMC premises, with appropriate user access permissions.
It would be a success if wireless connectivity in the workplace was faster and more efficient. The scanners may cost money, but this is a once-off investment. Perhaps EMC-RSA could find a way to leverage this idea and turn it into a commercial product.
