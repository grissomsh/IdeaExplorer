Talent Development Network - Ireland COE
Four challenges identified in the Ireland CoE challenge and this idea offers a part of the solution for each.
*Improved communication
*Deliver enhanced collaboration
*Build a workplace of the future
*Up-skill our existing talent 
My prime focus is on provision of training to my specific function. I'd like to know who else is providing training across the COE, what is their approach, what results do they get and is this something I can bring back.
Instigate a facilitated forum through HR-Talent Development for trainers across BU's to meet through structured quarterly meetings, forging links across businesses....

* Share best practices in training design, delivery & evaluation.
* Share innovative approaches to training interventions.
* Tap into the experience, skill, specialist and Tacit knowledge of our members.
* Showcase various functions within the COE.
* Presentations from industry guru's & best practice visits
* Strategy talks from COE leadership

This does not exist right now and would have a clear pathway to implementation.
The greatest value to the business is to have this specific subset of employees understand the goals and interrelationships between departments and as trainers be in a position to pass this on.

Success for this idea looks like:
* Structured Meetings - eg: overview of activities, guest speaker, focus on a BU
* Sharing & recommending value- (use of Skillnets etc.)
* CoE leadership talks - strategy, future skills, building positive culture
* L&D guru talks and adoption of best practices across group
* Promote the development of Evaluation/ROI metrics
* Gaining competitive advantage through people
