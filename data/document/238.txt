Roadrunner - Hit the ground running
Roadrunner benefits the E2E Horizon team by providing an efficient, scalable process through a simple management tool with easily measurable cost savings. Customers will receive product sooner with lower internal costs to IT.
In early June, a co-worker related their experience with project overlap. I was finishing a book on Scrum when it hit me.  I typed up my ideas regarding the issue and the following week Chris Walsh pulled me aside and asked me to come up with a problem which we could use for a scrum training exercise.  Together with 3 of my Co-workers,  we were able to further flesh out our solution to remove duplicity of labor.
Unlike other project management software, Roadrunner maintains an awareness of all EMC projects past and present. Roadrunner will create a central repository with real time searching of past and present projects along with new project ideas to identify correlating projects and quick access to 'lessons learned' on past projects. It might also compare customer requests for similar functionality.  The program will reduce failed projects, increase productivity, and insure products maximize their customer base through cross-functional collaboration. I suspect the service might connect to Service Now.
If we successful remove duplication of work on IT projects, I suspect the savings would be several million dollars within the first couple of years.  Greater transparency and collaboration among departments from project initiation would enhance productivity, deliver more value per product, and shorten time to market bringing greater customer satisfaction.
