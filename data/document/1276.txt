1 virtual team with a set of common goals (regardless of location or organizational structure). 
Help make individuals more productive, happier and generate a sense of OneIT.
This idea was generated at an IT Idea Generation Session in Cork on 25th June.
Quarterly IT formulates 5 groups (e.g. blue, red, yellow, green, purple), each with a common set of goals and priority lists. Each major location is designed and decorated to fit these colors. 

Each area should have large screens with CAMs of the other locations so that it is 1 global virtual team. These monitors could switch to Video Conference units too and double up to display key themes, like shared "to do" lists, priorities, roadmaps, definitions, statuses, peopleâ€™s time off, recommended reading for the common goals etc. (Or some of this could be on whiteboards, chalkboards, posters, etc around the area - they key is to keep everyone focused and informed). Emphasis should be placed on thinking of the team as a real community and making it fun. 

One day a week each team assembles where the objective is to get to a number of decisions made (not confined to multiple 1 hour meetings). Spin off meetings could occur and come back together as needed. 

In this way we are brought together for a common purpose and things can be accomplished quicker.
A complete contemporary unified workplace experience (combination of IT and Facilities).
