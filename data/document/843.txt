Exchanging employees came from the idea of exchanging the employees worldwide with different cultlures and different background, and also in our deperement there is this idea but within the same department but across the COEs, and the shadwing with the COE's manager came from my previous workplace
The idea is simple and is exisiting with students worldwide, exchanging employees with the same COE in different departments duration is from 1 day up to 5 days, depends on the department's workload and knowledge needed
helping the employees to find their right career path and know all the EMC prouducts, and it will help them to give more to the place they choose to work, it will also break the routine and bring some fun and confident to the workplace, and will encourage them to give more and to achive their goals,
