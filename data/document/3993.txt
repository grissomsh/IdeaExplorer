VPLEX Virtual Edition Product Bundled with H/W OEM Partners

Being the version one product, we had faced multiple issues regarding the supported hardware/software, installation/configuration and also to achieve the maximum throughput published from us, we had changed the hardware components and lots of software configuration to achieve it.
This idea will be useful for the new customers those who are interested to buy the VPLEX Virtual Edition product along with required hardware.
Recommended software needs to be pre-installed & pre-configured in the hardware with vSphere supported version and VPLEX Virtual Edition product.
Just need to be added in supported vCenter server and minimum networking reconfiguration required from customer as per existing Network & Storage.
