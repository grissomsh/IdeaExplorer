Lab-as-a-Service: Storage target selection by hop count

Michael Hancock came up with the idea while brain-storming services for XBU Lab-as-a-service (LaaS). LaaS currently provides the related services of bare-metal and virtual provisioning services for a variety of OS's and Hypervisors. The idea was further developed in discussions with Aditya Nadkarni, who confirmed that the eLab needs to specifically test hop counts of up to 5 and soon 7 through FC switches. Additional insight was gained in working sessions with Aditya Nadkarni, Saiprasad Thondavada, and Andrea Incampo.
On a network with a range of hop counts of at least two, configuration items including compute, switches, storage and connectivity is stored in a graph or relational DB. When the user requests storage provisioning services they may enter in a hop count as part of the selection criteria. The storage provisioning workflow will be extended with an activity and services that calculate the shortest paths for matching storage devices.

Current solutions are either manual requiring a network or storage administrator to identify arrays via the embedded facilities in a physical switch, or are selected by association via a pre-configured grouping of assets. The idea proposed eliminates unnecessary manual effort and/or sub-optimal asset pool configurations.
