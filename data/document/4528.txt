Mobile App to improve efficiency of scheduling of Mother’s Room throughout EMC facilities

Lisa Hall thought of this idea when trying to schedule the Mothers’ Room.  Currently a white board is used but a mobile app would be the best solution.  Lisa Hall, Melissa DiMotta, Lynne Maynard, Aleks Messier, Kristen Turco and Michelle Tran got together to brain storm on key features and functionalities.  
The Mothers’ Room Mobile App will be compatible for both iPhones and Androids to simplify the process of utilizing Mothers’ Rooms. This app would have features such as: on-demand scheduling of rooms, web access capability for those who don’t have a smartphone, a calendar view to see what is reserved/what is not, the ability to reserve in advance or book on the fly, check-in and check-out functions, as well as Mothers’ Room notifications of cancelations or reservations.  There would be opt-out options, mother profiles, ability to communicate, phone & badge to access rooms, guest access, Mothers’ Room finder – map / GPS to find an available room within close proximity, and ultimately—Global access, across any campus and any site that has a Mothers’ Room.
