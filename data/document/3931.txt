Improvements in Propel

Many such issues are faced by everyone using propel
Claimed & remaining hours claimed in a PAS
PAS should not be selectable if hours are exhausted
No need to manually select the PAS from Worklist, once assigned it should show up under WBS Element
Everyone should be able to change assignment dates (limited to SAs now)
