Diversity @ a Great place to work
The sponsor challenge is to make the workplace more Diverse.
My idea is to tap the existing potential rather than force Innovation
This is my sole idea. No external support.
I came up with this idea when I saw this challenge.
I do believe that the existing system is very much in tune with absorbing all the Innovative ideas from all the employees. When we have a system where equality persists, there wont be any worry about being diversify innovation.
The focus needs to be on tapping enthusiastic innovators rater than pressurizing innovation.
Innovation needs to be from within then external influence
Innovation is a outcome of a creative mind, combined with customer centric focus
