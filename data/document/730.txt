Power saving by having EMC shutdown across globe 
"Environmental Stewardship Challenge" has the need to address how we can save power consumption @ EMC. Our solution helps achieve this.
This is already followed by other IT companies so thought of having the same for EMC
We propose to have yearly twice complete shutdown of EMC for atleast 5 days (including weekend) across globe during this time
1. All the floor AC's/light/desktops will be off.
2. All the Testing and Development teams hardware labs will be powered off.
3. Minimum usage of power will be seen


Reason we are proposing is that we have observed during the year end, 80% of the people take leaves - we just wanted to propose the solution to be consistent across during the same time of the year which will benefit both EMC & the employees


Huge power savings will be reflected
