Redefine Lab By Software Define Data Center

when learning the Software Define Data Center
In a software-defined data center, all elements of the IT infrastructure( networking, storage, CPU and security) are virtualized and delivered as a service, so ITaaS may represent an outcome of SDDC.

There are three core components of the software-defined data center: network virtualization, server virtualization and storage virtualization.

We can use the VMware virtualization products to virtualize our Lab, thus this will reduce the IT budget, and automating the Lab management, including the resource and services.
