Pitch On-Demand
Keeping up with new technologies in the IT industry is a cumbersome yet crucial task for all IT personal. It requires hours of reading and orientation. In EMC there are many subject matter experts that can easily describe the main idea of emerging technol
Keeping up with new technologies is not an easy task. Personally, I like being aware and understanding new technologies, being able to answer customer questions about EMC technologies in the best way I can. I came up with this idea while preparing a presentation about EMC federation, and I found that there are many technologies are involved, and I wished that there would be someone who can give me useful reference material and put me on the right track. This way I would be able to save time and have better in-depth knowledge about the subject, hence, gain better control on the subject. 
Pitch On-Demand is a tool that lets tech-savy employees (i.e., subject matter experts) volunteer to help other non-technical oriented employees (e.g. sales and project managers) or employees new to the a certain topic to gain better understanding and orientation about the topic in question. 

Pitch On-Demand works by letting EMC employees post their demand for a pitch or introduction on a certain topic (e.g., cloud computing, federation, storage arrays, etc) for a public community of subject matter experts. Later on, subject matter experts can volunteer to give a pitch about the topic through either recording a video / sound or communicating it through a video conference session. 
  
There are multiple ways to implement "Pitch On-Demand". One way is through the use of Inside EMC global communities. People can go to the "Pitch On-Demand" community, post their Pitch request and have subject matter experts create a quick pitch for them.
