Linking Business Challenges with Human Capital

Idea first originated at a coffee morning meeting with senior management & a discussion around how EMC has provided significant investment in my training and development yet asks no more of me. Current situation appears to be Lose / Lose as neither party benefits. 
Challenge was explored with senior management team within GMO Cork  & support functions to identify the perspective of various stakeholder

An "Inside EMC" Forum provides a platform for the creation of a Challenge / Opportunity Wall, on which sponsors can post details of a particular business challenge & seek support from the wider EMC community to identify & implement innovative solutions. These posting would aim to attract the discretionary effort of a wider range of employees, providing an opportunity to utilise their skill set.
These challenges can be categorized into 2 distinct groups. “Hard Challenges” those focused on cost saving, operational efficiencies Etc. & those “Soft Challenges” around people, culture & sustainability
The Challenge / Opportunity Wall effectively communicate business needs ensuring goal congruence; as such employees are reassured of strong sponsorship due to the alignment with organisational goals. Employee engagement with such activities results in added benefits in the form of Motivation, Confidence, Self-Development, Experience, Networking & Enjoyment
Benefits to the organisation are that challenges are met by the efforts of a larger group of willing enthusiastic employees. The engagement with employees promotes Affective Commitment, creating an ongoing link with the organisation & a willingness to do more than just what contractually obliged.
Challenges need not be confined to employees of a particularly business unit, providing a network of resources & opportunities throughout EMC
