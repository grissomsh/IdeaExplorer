Write plugins or support the development of Open Source projects
Challenge is to help IT engineers that use open source projects combined with solution provided by EMC.
XtremIO can be used for any solution below to improve performance.
Just by discussing the innovation challenge
Write plugins and support famous open source projects that are used by commercial companies that will make users aware of solutions provided by EMC.
E.g.
- Wireshark – A plugin that can communicate with EMC arrays and display additional information about the packets.
- Jenkins/Hudson – Plugin to easily configure the job to work with EMC solutions, e.g.
      - Assist in extending/creating the volumes on which the artifacts reside  (in case they are in an EMC storage)
      - Alert in cases the allocated storage is running out.
      - Provide data analytics on build and test results.
- Open Source Databases Systems: MySQL, MongoDB, etc.:
      - provide tools for the user to visually mark Hot data to allow the storage system to put it on the desired tier.
      - provide migration tools from these databases to EMC GreenPlum
- Docker: We can create a containers for configuring and communicating with various EMC products  which other containers can interact with. E.g:
      - Allocate a dedicated LUN for their execution.
      - Retrieve statistics from DPA.
      - Create a snapshot in VMAX.


People choosing the above open source products will know they have EMC's support and help
People choosing these products but wasn't aware of EMC will get acquainted with it
