SHIELD THE SYMM

Found in DATA CENTER, producing lot of SOUND as well HEAT, so they need to keep the AC on always, increasing the cost of DATA CENTER.
Storage system generate lot of heat and sound. 
SHIELD technology used in ‘AUTOMATIVE [EX: CAR ]’, can we use appropriate technology that reduces the SOUND and HEAT. Might be convert that energy [ heat and sound ] to POWER supply for SYMM again.

Helps in reducing the COST to DATA CENTER and Go-GREEN, as we recycle heat/sound to power.
