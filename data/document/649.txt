Intelligent power management solution for data backup system 
This idea is to help manage power system according to the specific schedule, and the predictive result of the systemâ€™s operation to save the power consuming, also provide historical data mining for the future design of the whole system. 
power saving is a popular issue in product design, it is required especially to help solve the coming global energy shortage issues. So, when we have involved the HW power management(power on/off) and hotplug features in our product design, the intelligent power saving solution should show up to help both us and customer with the energy issue.  
the solution provides the power consuming database and library according to the HW design, a library to allow user to specify their operation schedule, a library to record the systems operations and the energy consuming per the data from the sensor, a rule based library to learn and analyze the behavior of the system and try to predict the energy consuming and report it to the user and data center. and according to the prediction and the schedule, powered on/off the specific HW for the job or saving the energy.

it should power off some HW parts when they are not needed automatically, and power on and prepare the specific device when they are required intelligently. it also provides some energy data for us to help the future design and for the customers to integrate them into a bigger energy management system. it will enhance the productivity and save the money for customer.
