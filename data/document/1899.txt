IoT of trust
The idea introduces a mechanism to reduce risks on controlling a remote device through Internet.
Recently, thoughts on various devices.
Like the solution for web trust:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_of_trust
I would like to introduce a trusted third party to authenticae/authorize the instruction from remote.

Precondition: 
1. the device has sandbox for remote instruction against local instruction(without Internet/remote control).
2. third party works like CA, but for switching instructions instead of identity check.

Steps:
1. controlled device and controller are configured to know the third party.
2. controller sends an instruction to controlled device.
2.1 controller sends the instruction to the third party and get a token, under control of web of trust.
2.2 controller sends the token to the controlled device.
3. controlled device receives a request with token from the controller.
3.1 controlled device fetches the instruction using the token, under control of web of trust.
3.2 if everything is OK, exeucte the instrustion
3.3 if needed, response result to the controller directly 

 

More and more users will use remote devices without security concerns.
EMC will build a service like VeriSign/Thawte provided.
