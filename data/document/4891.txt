Incorporation of USB ports on the VPLEX Engines facilitating flashing director firmware directly

There was a need to flash firmware on the directors and we faced delay in doing so due to sms not in optimal state. So this is an alternate way to flash firmware
on directors thus reducing sms dependency.
If we incorporate USB ports on the directors of engines, we can load the firmware image on other storage devices like a pen drive and flash the firmware by connecting it to the USB port. This avoids the dependency of the directors on the sms for flashing firmware.
