Implementing Dockers Container on top of Hypervisor in Android phones/tablets.
Inaccessibility to Business tools on smart devices during travels and trips.
Incapability to make use of existing Windows/Linux softwares for the people not having laptops. 
Repetitive efforts and dependency issues to re-write applications for Android OS.
Not having business application on mobile as a universal problem.
80-90% of smart devices (phones and tablets) are Android based and remaining are running on Windows and IOS. Smart devices are running on powerful processors, higher memory and bigger storage. We can develop hypervisors and on top of them we can run a light weight machine - "Dockers" specially designed for mobile hardware as well as Android OS. Moreover additional peripherals like keyboards/HDMI/USBs are also there in market for leveraged use and ease. 

A layer between Android and Docker container - say Hypervisor, compatible Bare-metal hypervisor OR Hosted hypervisor can be developed in order to reach this solution.

Lightweight containers technology/feature (DOCKERS) can be combined with hypervisor for making this layer independent of version releases and underlying hardware/software base. By using Dockers we can make that layer available for Apple IOS as well with comparatively lessor efforts.

VMWARE-VDI features can also be merged with this as a bigger picture.

All business applications which are there for operating systems like Windows/Linux etc, will be available on Android Tabs and Phones.
Required approvals from available tools,portals,softwares like EAS, Goals etc can be provided Easily and timely from managers and business executives. 
Revolutionary step in IT industry.
Universal applicability.
