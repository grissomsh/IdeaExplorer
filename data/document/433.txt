Port Defect Verification and Defect logged Matrix to Dashboard.
Present QA has to Manually Pull the resolved defects by Query , export to a excel sheet and do manual sorting, filter and assign it each individual for Verification. Similarly to know the defect logged defect for a project QA has to write Query and pull the data
from Bugzilla. which are cucumber sum  activity.This happens every release.And also the Triage takes place using excel sheet or Query. 
Right now its manual effort we are following for current project.
to overcome the manual effort, this motivated to submit this idea.

Right now we have QA dashboard which has one single point where management and as well as 
Dev/QA refers to know the QC execution status.

Similar basis, port the Defect verification , defects logged, info state bugs,Assigned defects, info state defects , Triaged defects , Deferred defects. It should be of Dynamic
display of these data.



1)No need of daily follow-up by mail
2)No need of exporting this data excel sheet and follow-up.
3)Reduces dev/QA time in pulling the data and doing data
4)current status report
5)no mail notification.
