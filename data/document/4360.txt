Travel Ambassadors Web Portal

NA
Since EMC employees travel frequently in business trips all around the world, the idea is to create a travel web portal that would allow employees to register their names as ambassadors for their countries. 

How the idea works:
1- An interested employee register his name in the ambassador web portal
2- The ambassador employee is contacted when another EMC employee (from another GEO) is traveling to his country.
3- The ambassador employee will have the following duties:
   a- Welcome EMC traveler in the airport.
   b- Guide and facilitate EMC traveler in the country.
   c- Provide an Emergency contact number.

Benefits of the idea:
1- Provide a safer option for the traveler (he will be contacted by an EMC employee).
2- Allow EMC employees from across the globe to know each other.
3- Cut the cost of travel for EMC. 
4- Ambassador employees will receive a compensation allowance.
