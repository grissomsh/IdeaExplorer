Real time challenge 
My solution is helping those people out by developing the service centers with newer and much shown tabs that may help those people, so if you want to ask customer about approval instead of putting this on the SR as an update, no, you choose a tab called "Customer approval requests" and this will lead you to another tab "formatting track for example" or "removing a thin device" this will be much easier, saves time and makes it easier to the one who is responsible for that to assign the correct guy
