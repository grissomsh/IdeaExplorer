Proactive Monitoring Service for EMC Equipment
Many customers would welcome the idea of EMC being on top of logs and alarms coming out of their equipment and being proactive in resolving or sending warnings to the customer for a preventative action. If we can add this process, it would add to TCE and can be a service to be sold to our customers which would definitely increase revenue. It would also save costs of break fix as the issues are resolved before hand
I have worked in previous multi-nationals where they had a central monitoring system that grabbed alarms from all customers' equipment. Proactive monitoring teams used to open SRs for any alerts or serious warnings. My idea here is more of being interactive with the customer based on what the monitoring tool would mention. I know that VNX engineering team is already working on presenting all the alarms and logs and statistics of VNX on a graphical environment
If we can add a process or a tool that would analyze alarms and utilization of CPUs and disks at customers, then a team would be responsible to communicate with customers to inform them with things like "Take Care, utilization on your disk has reached 75%, you might need to consider so and so", it would add to TCE and can be a service to be sold to our customers which would definitely increase revenue. It would also save costs of break fix as the issues are resolved before hand. 
It could also be color coded using green for healthy, yellow for warnings and red for major alerts
Phase 1: would be to see a tool that is easy to use by tech or non tech teams which presents the logs and alarms in graphical format
Phase 2: Would be to dedicate a few resources to monitor and start communicating with a customer proactively
Phase 3: This service to be sold to customers and Proactive Monitoring team to be built for that
