 ‘Innovation Roadmap Team builder’ - Enhance Roadmap quality using big data recommender engine.

The idea aims at grouping diverse teams from different locations and backgrounds to work together in innovation roadmap as a team based on common interest to achieve higher quality. 

 the idea came up while I was thinking about having "brain storming sessions" to allow different innovators to share opinions and generate high quality ideas. Now I am considering doing this automatically using big data on the showcase text data.
 1- we will use data analytics techniques such as text analysis, classification methods and topical modelling to process the huge number of ideas in the showcase and detect highly relevant ideas and group them together.

2- the showcase will automatically notify the innovators of these ideas and suggest that they can work together building a team. the innovators can then contact each other.

3- this will be used afterwards by the ideas reviewers to assess ideas more easily.


1-	 Enhances innovation at EMC
2-	Promotes diversity in innovation teams
3-	Easier innovation lifecycle process.
