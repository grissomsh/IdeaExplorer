Import Excel option in Global Scheduler
Importing the Shift details from excel will make the updating in Global Scheduler easier and quicker. Ours is a dynamic team when the schedule needs to be assigned or changed everyday. Its very time consuming to manually update all the details and verify the same. 
I had included to import the schedule from excel when I did a project using VB during my graduation. 
Reduces manually maintenance of schedule in Excel, Software. Reduces time of management to upload the schedule every month and every day. Avoids confusions to engineer and WFM for monitoring.
