Break TV Room



I noticed that lately the match is one the important topics at the office and thought why not share it with my colleagues  as a stress release break time for us.it will help increase customer satisfaction and motivate them.


A room with bean bags or comfy chairs could be used to help employees relax on their break. They can tune in on the latest movies if they are planning to stay late at work or even sit there work infront of the TV. Some employees enjoy that and find it relaxing to work, others would like to use it as a switch of button to the meetings calls and work they already have.
