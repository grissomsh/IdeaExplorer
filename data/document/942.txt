“Affinity Groups” - Amplify Diversity 
Creating "Affinity Groups" within the organization to celebrate and leverage the difference. This will be a platform to bring all people who share common interests together to innovate. Affinity groups will be the forum to network, collaborate and socialize for the people from various diversity (cultural/differently-abled/gender/multi-gen/economic) backgrounds, across teams, across BUs.
We couldn’t find any forum which brought various diversity people together to share the their ideas across the organization
Within our organization, we should form "affinity groups" which will bring all like-minded people together to share their experiences, collaborate and leverage their difference.  This will eliminate the barriers and impediments and ensure people who share common interests come together and discuss.  You can correlate this idea with "Google group services" offered by Google Inc.
