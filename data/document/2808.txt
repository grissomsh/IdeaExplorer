Automation scripts to support next generation products
This Idea would to reduce learning curve for support and implementation team
Enhance the speed of learning of new functionalities of product by support,customers etc
Leverage the existing automation scripts from test environment
Develops coordination and 
Idea came when user trying automate the new functionality "policy workflow" of Enterprise class backup product and saw customer modifying scripts for replication due to changes.
Testing team always develops the scripts to test functionalities if these scripts are exposed to support,implementation and other communities 

This can be exposed as a section in support web site 
or 
As an Automation leverage link within the dashboard page of the product
or 
Sharing it in support community group 

Eg: Need to modify schedule time of 25 workflows in a policy
$i=1;
while($i<26)
{
system("nsrpolicy workflow update -p POLICY_P1 -w WF$i -S "13:00"");  $i++;
}
Disables the schedule time of 100 workflows within a policy
$i=0;
while($i<101)
{
 system('nsrpolicy workflow update -u no -w <workflow-name>'."$i".' -p <policy-name>');
$i++;
} 

Learning curve of implementing new functionality can be reduced
Changes to existing product could be easily implemented
Modifications to existing scripts becomes simple
Communication between support/implementation and test teams are established
