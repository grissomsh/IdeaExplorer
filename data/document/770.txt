Sales Team To approach Major Hospitals In Egypt To Create A Global Patient Database - Similar To Australia
This is a new way to increase EMC sales and at the same time benefit our country. 

We have seen several issues and life threatening cases that happen because the application is not working or because the data is not available right now. Drs. don't have medical history for patients. 

In Australia, there is a global system where Drs can view all the data related to one patient and can update it too so all Drs would have the history of that person. 
We can target all major hospitals and make them use EMC technology aiming at creating one database that has all the medical history of patient. Drs. in different hospitals can view and edit that. 

This will also increase EMC sales and expansion in EMEA. 
This would entail all the benefits that EMC hardware and software provides to its customers. Only this time, we will be serving our country and increasing EMC sales.

One unified database for hospitals will do miracles!
