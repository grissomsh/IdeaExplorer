Leads and opportunity process
This Idea is going to enhance and make better collaboration between teams
Idea came from the process of ASC team when dealing with cleanup process for EMC accounts.
we need to enhance the salesforce tool to be linked to Install Base and to create a simple way on mobile app to give chance for sales admin to close leads and Opportunities that has been closed.
On other hand to send notification to sales admin about leads and Opportunities that are open for long time in order to keep data accurate.

New sales force to be used by all department to have one pool of data and to be viewed by all teams.
1) Change layout of Salesforce
2) Connect Salesforce with Oracle 11i
3) Implement New mobile Tool to be connected to salesforce and have sales admin profiles
4) Revenue enablment from this enhancment will be captured from data added to the correct qoutes
5) Deactivation for dupplicate parties on install base will raise and this will raise accuracy of EMC data base.
6) Creating leads and Opportunities will be more easy from sales admin
