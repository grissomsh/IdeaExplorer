MyCity – Video/Photo Surveillance by EMC Employee/Citizens of City
1. Relevant to smart city where Govt require help from Citizen to improve lives of city
2. Resource allocation by Govt
3. Scalable to various cities around World
(This idea won 1st prize in community challenge last year at Banglore CoE)
When i brainstormed around Smart city discussion in India and around world, I could think of citizen as equally responsible for city improvement.

1. Provide an interface to post photo or capture short video of problem.
   At time of submitting, it will capture location of Site from where problem is submitted.
2. Capture IP address for legal aspects of identification.
3. Add watermark during upload and also add watermark at server side  (sort of PKI but in watermarks) to protect original data.
4. Upload to cloud storage will ensure there is not tapering at User end or at server end and can be used by City’s corporation / Government.
5. Provide unique identifier to problem for follow-up.
6. Tie-up with NGO for further follow-up.

Implementation
1. Andriod App , Cloud interface
2. Network cost is paid by employee or person participating – at client and EMC at server side.

Other details :
1. Start with employee only option. 
2.  Make it invite fwded by Employee to their network/contacts etc.
3.  EMC can provide public Cloud interface for more such applications.

This can be scaled or implemented to any City that EMC CoE or has office in.

Benefits
1. EMC can make cloud storage available
2. EMC will get exposure to community involvement.
3. Participation from employees ( to start with) and later invite based participation from citizen will ensure there aren’t any legal issues.
4. This solution can be initially funded by EMC and later on work with Local GOVT for funding for Smart CITY solution.
