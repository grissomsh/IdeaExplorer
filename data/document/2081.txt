Intelligent Management for Inactive Virtual Resources in Data Center
Our solution is to automate the management for inactive resources, could optimize the usage of shared resources, this matches Durham Data Center Elastic Labs Challenge.

Our solution reduces the power cost, may be up to 30%+, with deeper optimization, we could achieve 60% energy efficiency increase for Data Center, this matches Environmental  Stewardship Challenge.
In the group discussion we identified a solution for automated deployment of those virtual machines inactive in a regular manner. In later discussion we decide to use suspension as it's quicker and possible to support real-time wake-up.
Our approach is based on the function of suspending / resuming (or waking up) of a virtual machine. A suspended virtual machine will only take up disk space but will save memory, CPU resource and most importantly, the energy.

The idea is to allow automated suspension / waking up of these virtual machines following a predefined policy. As examples, we list three useful policies, which are automated:


Policy 1 -- suspend / wake up on user-defined schedule:
• Suspend virtual machines at a scheduled time point. E.g. 6 pm every working day (leaving office time) and weekends.

• Wake up an auto-suspended virtual machines at a scheduled time point. E.g. 8 am every working day.

NOTE: the wake-up on request can be implemented as a feature in the network virtualization layer of the data center controller.


Policy 2 -- suspend / wake up on activity status:

• Suspend virtual machine inactive (e.g. No in-coming request) for a certain period (e.g. 1 hour).

• Wake up an auto-suspended virtual machine when there is access from outside (e.g. There is HTTP or RDP request to the virtual machine).

NOTE: since resuming a virtual server from suspension status is quick, we can support real-time wake-up. 


Policy 3 -- suspend / wake up on the specific requirement of tasks running on the machine:

• Suspend virtual machine when the task finishes running (need to get the notification from the task).

• Wake up an auto-suspended virtual machine when the task needs to be run.

NOTE: the notification can be implemented by the SDK of virtualization technology.



The auto-suspension / wake up need to be provided by a controller module in the data center controller software.
If this idea is implemented, the power cost could be reduced.
