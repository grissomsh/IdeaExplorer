Water and seating  arrangments.

Most of the CAB drivers have shared this problems and I have also noticed them standing all the time when we go to board the  cab.

WATER is the basic of all.We can survive with out food for a day or two but with out water ??


Either Install  aquaguard in the base ment.

Or We can shift atleast 2 water cans to base ment on daily basis. 
Since no of cans  are delivered daily  for EMC which will easily cross 50.
So providing 2 cans to the Cab drivers will not make any difference for the employees.Providing atleast 20 chairs will not make any differnce to us.IF so kinldy take our chairs from Pantry.we will be glad to help them.Carry water from house to office for the complete day  is very difficult even for us.
