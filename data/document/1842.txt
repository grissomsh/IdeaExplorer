Crèche
Having a crèche available to employees would help better with organizing a healthy work life balance. This would help drive the COE and the federation’s interest in building a Workplace of the future.
The idea was a product of a group innovation workshop incorporating employees across various teams within CS. The program was facilitated by co-ops. The idea was discussed and refined through group collaboration.
Our idea is to plan and generate interest in the possibility of having an onsite crèche available to employees as a service. The crèche does not need to be EMC run it could be something we could outsource. It would be a paid service that would open the same hours as employees and offer various rates and flexibility to people depending on needs.
The crèche would be available to all employees and would offer a quality service to all. The crèche does not need to be within the main building it could be offered as a service within or close to the relevant sites.

The benefits of this are it would provide an excellent service to employees, allow employees a bit more freedom from time constraints that regular crèche’s have, this would in turn lead to a healthier work lifestyle and help contribute towards marketing the COE as a workplace of the future.
The success of this would depend on the uptake with employees and once a competitive convenient service was offered it is hard to see it not having every chance for success.
