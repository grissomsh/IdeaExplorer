Polaris Improvement
New add on features of Polaris
We usually upload all our updated trackers in Polaris & during mid of Q-end i happened to delete a very important file which belong to other region, thinking Its my tracker (with obsolete data). That's when i got a click, if pop up message would have had the file name, i wouldn't have made this error resulting in data loss & rework during Q-end when work pressure is at its peak.
So the pop message should specify the file name to be deleted before deletion.
Accuracy & hard stop to data/ File loss.
