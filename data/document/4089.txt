The simple life with "My Voice" for managers and HR

The idea came up in the process of analyzing My Voice results of 2012 and 2013.
The first step should be done to improve the understanding and analysis of My Voice results for managers. To my mind, the results should be available in the following form: at the beginning there are high rates of the business unit, then the rates of possibilities and in the end the least. Besides these rates should be displayed in the comparison with the results of previous years, of other BUs and in the certain sheet with all center, organisation. Moreover, I think it would be more effective for managers also to see the results of similar BUs by region and by format. 
So the results would be in the benchmarking form of space and time for better understanding of progress and comparison with others.
