Encourage Employee Resource Groups(ERG)
More diversified environment
Found it while exploring more best practices for Diversity.
Employee resource groups (also known as ERGs, affinity groups, or business network groups) are groups of employees who join together in their workplace based on shared characteristics or life experiences. ERG's are generally based on providing support, enhancing career development, and contributing to personal development in the work environment. In the past, ERGs have traditionally been focused on personality traits or characteristics, for example women, religious affiliations, sexual orientation, gender, etc. With the resurgence of ERGs in the workplace, ERGs are expanding to "interest-based" groups gathered around particular activities. - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employee_resource_groups
