EMC Strategy Engagement Suite/Wall

Attempting to keep myself and the team up to date on EMC strategy meant accessing several sources and sometimes it was difficult to know if you were looking at the most up to date information. Understanding how to communicate the strategy is also a challenge
Create a space (wall, suite, corner of canteen, briefing center, reception, coffee pod wall, etc) that has a lot of easy to consume information on the current EMC strategy that allows the user to browse and engage at a leisurely pace with the strategy through a number of media mechanism. Posters, Video's (EMC world, corporate interviews, analysts views) , Latest social media feeds, Booklets (online or otherwise). Depending on what the strategy it could also include props (RSA fobs, mini setups of EMC products in action). Anything that would help people engage and develop a deeper understanding of EMC current strategy would be permitted. This could be matched with a single online repository that could be accessed remotely.
