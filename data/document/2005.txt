Cloud of books Application
By creating EMC Cloud of Books for Employees,it will help in building the great workplace of the future.
Creating an easy way for employees to listen to Audio books or read them as PDF on the mobiles will upskill our existing talents and give them more knowledge to face the upcoming challenges.
I borrowed a book from our Egypt COE library , but i couldn't finish it completely as i Couldn't find much time to sit down and read.
I got some Audio Summaries from GetAbstract and listened to more than 15 Audio summary in the car but that summaries are just 7 to 10 Mins maximum and will not give you all the knowledge that you can extract from that book and the author for that specific subject.
Creating a cloud Library of Audio / PDF Books that can be accessed through mobiles or tablets for all EMC Employees around the globe will give employees the ability to listen to audio books while driving or walking . reading while they are waiting for anything or in any kind of transportation.
Gaining knowledge by this easy way will of course upskill and develop the employees.
The idea will look like a Youtube Application on the mobile but for Books only with the ability for the users to write reviews and invite others to read that book.
The idea will save money for EMC as a whole as each Country could buy books for there Employees locally , while we can buy a book and use it globally.
The idea will Enhance productivity as the Employees will gain more knowledge and will be able to use there spare time wisely.
