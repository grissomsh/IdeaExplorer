EMC Public Cloud Offering for SMBs
CIOs take a portfolio view with some portion of their IT being aligned with a public cloud like Amazon (E.G: Test/Dev environment), remaining data/applications residing in a more secure, specialized location (e.g. Hybrid/Private clouds or Traditional datacenters). Many upcoming SMBs cannot afford this blended(need citation) approach of public/private cloud & usually go for Public service offerings. 
Therefore EMC should move into Public cloud services & provide solutions for SMBs
EMC has wide variety of product portfolios, supports multiple sectors, but EMC still provides only Hybrid cloud solutions & leverages infrastructure through resellers for public cloud services. 
Expenditure on public IT cloud services, especially services provided off-premise, is growing 23% annually to an expected $108B in 2017.

The cloud infrastructure should be made available to a small/medium industry group and should be owned by EMC Public cloud services.

Target SMB clients: 
Wholesale, retail-trade, transportation, consumer services, etc

EMC should provide Infrastructure as a Service bundled with softwares, providing standardized hardware and computing resources that can interact with various application systems, by partnering with application vendors like Oracle, Microsoft, SAP, etc.

With EMCâ€™s vast product range, EMC offered Public cloud can support multiple complex scenarios using EMC Federation for Storage/Software defined storage (EMC II), Computing (VMware), Security (RSA), Platform (Pivotal) & Cloud management software (Virtustream)

EMC can initially start with Public Cloud Offerings to new or existing SMBs. Upon gaining the customer confidence, EMC can gradually transition customers to Hybrid Cloud.

Currently, traditional SMBs make use hundreds or even thousands of apps/hardware accessed by thousands or maybe tens of thousands of users. This is a growing market which is emerging & few accomplished vendors have a strong foothold. 

By moving into Public cloud business, EMC can increase profitability and deepen customer relationships by selling cloud offerings without intervention of resellers/partners. This will also help EMC penetrate the hybrid cloud market.

Opportunity to sell added benefits like Business Intelligence (Big-data/analytics) & disaster recovery protection as a future roadmap

EMC can provide & build better customer relationship by providing end to end IT Solutions/Services.
