Connect the talents, make it a real federation
this solution provide a platform for better technologies exchange and communication for talents from different federation members and different BUs, uniting them to make it a real federation. It also brings diversity to the innovation process, make innovation a frequent and regular activity.
Currently, crowd sourcing is very prevalent, everyone can fund a project the he is interested in. We can bring this idea into our federation -- Every talents within the  federation can contribute his skills and effort to the projects/solutions raised by other colleagues.
For that reason, I propose to build a “playground”, that is, a website/platform for our talents with the federation, to improve the technologies exchange and communication. 
(1)When someone come up with an idea, he can post his idea to this website and create a virtual project, various talents who are interested in this idea and have the necessary skill sets can join the project, all the talents in this project work together and make the idea into a product/solution etc. While working together, the talents within this project can learn from each other, thus improve technologies exchange and communication.
(2)When CTO office/BUs have a specific requirement, they can also create a virtual project in this platform, and talents who are interested in can join the project, CTO office/BUs can fund this project if necessary (provide equipment ect ).
(3)When someone encounter a specific technical problem, he can also post it to this platform, to seek help from other talents within the federation
(4) For ideas fail to win in the innovation roadmap but have potential values to the federation, we can create a virtual project in this platform and built a prototype to assess the values of it
this solution is able to improve technological exchange and communication, improve collaboration within the federation. it also brings in diversity into innovation process, provide great opportunities for various talents from different countries/ethnic/gender to work together
