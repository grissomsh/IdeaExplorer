Improve VNX All frash array performance using the XtreamIO XDP

When reading the XtremIO material.
XDP presumes random access media such as flash is present in the array, and thus it can layout data
and read it back in highly efficient ways that would heavily penalize a disk-based RAID algorithm, but with no ill effects in
XtremIOâ€™s all-flash architecture.

we can refer to the XtremIO Data Protection White Paper for the detail algorithms
