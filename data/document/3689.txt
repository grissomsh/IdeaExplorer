GS support to sales

While doing some brainstorming for one of the other session, this ideas came up which made sense and more aligned to GS support to overall solution making for customer from sales point of view.
Forming a SWOT team within GS having representation from all BUs within GS. This team knows different customer sectors and their environment very well. This team being closest to practical customer issues will make the solutions for different sectors of customer like banking, insurance, retail, hospital etc.
