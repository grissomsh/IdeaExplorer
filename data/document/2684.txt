Introduce Books on Foreign Language and Cross Culture to the existing Library/EMC site
This innovation is about Great Place to Work
This idea is from my previous experience.
To introduce Foreign Language books translated in English, which will be of use to have a basic knowledge during or prior to their travel. 
In a foreign language perspective, asking what kind of knowledge and understanding about cultures is necessary to learn another language and communicate.

To introduce cross cultural books which will be of use to the employee to understand their culture.
We may work with members of other cultural groups. We may learn a foreign language. Such situations inevitably bring us into contact with other ways of speaking, other modes of behavior and other views of life.

To introduce Online system, wherein an employee can login and check to access the book if its available.  

Employees who have travelled before, can give a write-up of their experience or provide a ready handbook which will be useful for the employee who is yet to travel.

Employees sometimes prefer to read books than to search on Google.
This idea makes EMC even more a better place to work.
