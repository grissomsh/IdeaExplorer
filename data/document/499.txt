Templates for OSS contribution
The idea would encourage people to participate in OSS contribution and accelerate the movement to EMC and OSS collaboration
The idea was born thinking about the RCoE OSS Competence Centre tasks.  
The idea is to develop a set of ‘templates’ for OSS contribution:
1. Analyze existing businesses built on OSS contribution ranging them by contribution’s type:
- free version of a product;
- new feature;
- enhancement.
2. Define benefits of every business scheme.
3. Apply a template to EMC products to find out how it ( or a part of a product) could be contributed to OSS and what benefits it would bring to EMC/BU/Project team.

Templates show how to develop a product leveraging OSS contribution, what benefits it brings to EMC/BU/Project team.
Next it makes PMT to initiate activities to apply the scheme described by the template to the current development process.
Finally the efficiency of the product development increases significantly providing additional profit or costs cutting.
