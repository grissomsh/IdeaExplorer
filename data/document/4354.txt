Loyality Program

I've been in EMC for almost 2 years and I would like to stay more here but I see other companies have more benefits that I would like to have.
As an employee if you stay longer you get more benefits from profit share, discounts, car allowance to schooling discounts and many more. So you will have a range of benefits that will be giving against a range of years spent in the company. How will the company benefit from this:
   - Turnover percentage will be low
   - Happier employees
   - Motivational benefits keep employees in the company longer

How will the employees benefit:
   - Security 
   - Feeling valued with the longer time they stay

In the end EMC will be a better place to work.
