Cashless Canteen

Same idea is implemented in colleges around the country
Taking money from the ATM has a cost associated to it and by giving the option of using your EMC Card and a top-up method (from payroll or online service) you will be able to eliminate this cost. Also it would make the queues quicker in the canteen which have got substantially longer over the past year, especially at the end of quarter. Finally, it would allow for trends to be formed that could be analysed by both canteen staff (see what is actually selling, make offers/prizes/rewards based on the information) and by the individual (allows to see what your spending, align it with the UCC Healthy Eating Scheme currently ongoing to track what you are eating, calories etc.)
