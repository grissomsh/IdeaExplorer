COEs Virtual Tour app
This idea is about to make the EMC COEs and offices available to everyone and accessed it through internet, this experience will increase of croud sourcing of the employees from any EMC office and increase the social involvement of EMC employees.
This idea will be similar to google street view
My idea is to create an app that it can be used on multiple platforms like iOS and android and with it we can have a virtual experience to different EMC center of excellence around the world, we can have pictures from inside the center and the employees and the flow of the work and what are the business units that exists in each center and increase the involvement of employees across COEs not local; basically transforming the experience of working in each COE through your mobile.
If the idea is implemented, it will enhance productivity by giving the employees an experience to visit another place without leaving the office, optimize the employees involvement globally not just local involvement and gaining experience and dealing with different cultural background.
