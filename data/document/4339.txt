OpenStack over multiple hypervisors 

I have used OpenStack to build VDI, and find it is a very friendly IaaS. I extend many functions on it.
Currently Education Services only offer video playing, if use VM as a service, can provide environments which match the content of video. 
Use RESTful api can extend many new functions, and through it can control vCenter or other hypervisors. OpenStackâ€™s dashboard uses django, it is so easy to customize. And existing VMs can migrate to OpenStack.
