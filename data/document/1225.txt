Securing IoT Devices through Central IoT Control Appliance
> The widespread adoption of IoT/ Conected Devices is increasing by the day, and as security is one of the major challenges being posed. The need for a good architecture is vital for its sustained use.
> This idea directly targets at the heart of IoT infrastructure.
->This idea is been presented based on various challenges exhibited currently in the IoT World.
->Also an inspiration from Real Time Operating System(RTOS) and Application Specific Operating Systems(ASOS)
->Introduce a Central IoT Control Appliance, typically a medium sized computing device, which generates instructions on the fly (ie, As in Real Time Operating Systems) and directly injects instructions on to the physical devices's RAM/Memory Space.
->A new device should be initially registered to the appliance though the process of probing. This reveals all the operations that can be performed by the device.
->No pre-installed operating environment is made available.
->The edge device has a basic FTP/TFTP enabled to receive  instructions from the appliance.
->Users identity information and role is maintained within the appliance, and as the edge devices are TPM enabled, unique identity is captured for each of them.
->When generating instructions both device identity and the instruction itself are communicated to the edge devices.

->Targets security from the ground up.
->Easier lifecycle management of edge devices through a lightweight virtualization.
->Reduced risk of infrastructure breaches, privacy, and data integrity issues.
