Change Tap Water Mechanism
The challenge is to find a way to better utulize the resourses. In my idea, i am finding a way to save water. 
A huge amount of water is wasted everyday. This huge amount could be saved easily.
The solution is to change the normal tap water to sensored one. Instead of having manual taps, change them to ones with sensors. When the employee approach his hand towards the tap the water goes down automatically.

This way a huge amount of water will be saved. 
- It will help is saving one of the most important resources on earth which is water. 
- Eventually saving money on the company.
