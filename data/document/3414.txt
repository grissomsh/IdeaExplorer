 Use Big Data Analytics to have “Green Arrays”

 The idea came from the sensor networks technologies where the energy is the critical focus and everything else is optimized for it 
 Use data analytics in real time to collect data and metrics from the array about its power consumption and IO patterns. Data analytics techniques will run to analyze the data collected and provide insight on new patterns/approaches that can use less power. It can point out the factors that waste power the most and consider them in the next engineering phase for improvement
