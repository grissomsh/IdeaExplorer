Intelligent Graphical Log Parser & Analyzer
In any product, all the events are captured in a log file. At the same time the log file by itself is not giving any information, it is just a full of data. In an enterprise product, user will go mad by manually going thru sea of log messages and difficult to collect the required information in a short span of time. Also manual process will not give high level view / trend.  
Viewing & analyzing the log and find where the problem is traditional way. 

The proposed solution indicates where the problem lies. 
Analyzing the log, by loading it on a viewer / editor (vi / textpad), is a old traditional way. Why dont we break the old style, yes lets go Graphic. Lets analyze the log by looking it in a graphical way. Is it not a different experience by viewing the log graphically?  Yes it should be, if plotted the entire log by splitting it on daemon wise, log category wise, day wise, hour wise with respective counts of lines generated by them. 

By using proposed solution, the entire log of data is converted into information by graphical representation, which helps user to get the key data points without going thru the entire log. In other words, the UNSTRUCTURED data of lengthy log is converted into a STRUCTURED data, which is nothing but pre-analyzed or partially analyzed log. Once it is represented in structured (bar graph or line graph) format then that itself gives the user a confidence and interest to do further analysis (than boring in earlier way). 

In a first look itself from the graphical representation of log, the user gets a hint of possible problematic area at high level, which can be narrow down easily & quickly. 

How it can be implemented: 
- Data will be processed on backend and converted into graph and representation
will be on interactive UI (frontend)
- Make the frontend light weight, web based tool, user interactive tool
- Can choose between line graph or bar graph 
- Parsing can be done on the backend
- Graphs and interactive UI can be done using jquery, d3, dc, cross filter etc.
- Zoom In or Zoom out to control on the graph should expand the logs
- Provide ability to increase the scope (time range, specific category, specific daemon etc)
- Provide facility to remove/hide duplicated lines (repetitive lines of log)
- provide facility to remove/ hide user specified logs (which user is no longer interested) for quick analysis
- Provide popup window to view the actual logs fetched from the backend when user Clicking on certain 
graph (in time range, category selection, daemon selection, day selection, hourly selection, min wise selection etc)
- Popup windows should provide an additional capabilities such has searchable, export, copy from clipboard, etc.

This idea can be implemented for any product. It can made as a generic tool (Graphical Log Analyzer/Viewer) like any other editor, user just need to pre-set certain parameters to get the log in the structured format (Graphs).

Any body can use this tool, not just a QA / dev, it can be shared and used by support and customer too. 
* Time saving
* User satisfaction 
* Improves productivity 
* Leads to a resolution quickly and easily
