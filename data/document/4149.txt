Employee Desk Sharing Policy

Sharing of Desk helps in efficient workspace management.
If an employee is in a regular shift (for Ex: 9AM to 6PM), we can have his desk along with phone and monitor shared to another Employee making sure shift time will not overlap(may be from 9PM to 6AM). 
Also our Cisco phones support multiple extension configurations. In this way we can avoid costs on extra seats/phone/monitors. 
We can have some mobile seats for backup if any employee has any planned activity or extends their shifts.
With this, every employee feels they have a dedicated seat and also dedicated extension.
