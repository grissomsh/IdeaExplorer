IMAC team in Cairo COE
Here in Cairo COE we are having a massive number of employees relocations.

personally, I've moved my desk 2 times in around 18 months, a 3rd time might be coming.
I found my self spending hours and hours in the moved trying to pack/unpack connect/disconnect my stuff from my working hours which affects the TCE.
Having an IMAC team under the local IT department which is notified for every scheduled move to happen.
This team should be responsible for 
1-moving employee's IT devices with all connections during employee offshift.
2-make sure network and electric plugs are functioning properly.
3-keep the cabling neat and tidy.
4-keep track of hardware serial number with employee name and location.

Note: employee is responsible for packing his "personal" belongings in a box to be moved with by IMAC team to his new desk
1-No wasted hours from employees in the move.
2-EMC assists are kept safe from destruction.
3-keeping track of serial numbers, hardware owner and  location.
4-cabling are kept tidy.
