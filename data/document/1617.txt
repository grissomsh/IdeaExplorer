We have only changed the workplace 3 times in 5 years, thereby it reduced collaboration, reduced chances to meet new employees and if a person is on long leave/onsite it makes the place non-collaborative. There are lot of disadvantages and energy wastage with respect to static workplace , hence we came up with this idea
Changing business environment and new workforce call for a flexible workplace. 

Solution combines 
* Unified communication
* Web technologies
* Digital signage
* Media technology
 
The solution works by dynamically allocating seats based on employee reservations. 

1) A web-based application needs to be designed that allows end users to reserve a workplace one time or on a recurring basis. 

2) IP phone should be automatically updated based on the employee location as per the web application info

3) Web app should display the employee
    * Location
    * Meetings
    * How to get to employee location? etc

4) Room comforts should be integrated to web app as well like temperature, brightness etc 

IF NOT RESERVED, THE WORK PLACE SHOULD GO TO ENERGY SAVING MODE TURNING OFF LIGHTS AND AIR CONDITIONERS THUS SAVING ENERGY
 
* Dynamic work place environment
* Reduced real estate cost
* Opportunity to meet new people
* Collaborate effectively
* Save more energy
