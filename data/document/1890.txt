Virtual Departmental Library
Enhance the learning experience and improve accessibility and management of learning material within an organization
We started a traditional library in our organization, which turned out to be very successful. It became obvious that we could capitalize on this by taking this to the virtual level.
Provide a virtual library at the department level to provide eBooks that are specific to that department needs. 

For illustrative purposes, an Amazon account can be configured with up to 6 devices (physical or virtual) that can be accessed concurrently by employees.

The books contents can be accessed via the Cloud Web Reader (a web application) concurrently by employees regardless of time and location. Physical readers (e.g. kindles / tablets) can also be used depending on the organization needs. 

Benefits include:
- Encourage and enhance learning experience
- Reduced cost of training material as one library item may be concurrently accessed by 6 users
- Text search on learning material
- Easy to set up and maintain: Managed at a department level
- No book management issue (Check-in, wear and tear, loss of training material)
