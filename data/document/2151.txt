What can I do for the success of this organization?
We have various channels and forum for the employees to come up with idea's and innovation. But are we making use of it fully? If not, its a challenge. 
Most of the time, we give attention to innovation at a particular time, limited challenges. There are not many places we can run and test new ideas. The solution proposed can take care of it. 
Idea forum at a team/BU center level, assigned with action owner and brainstorm/implement the same. Reward each idea with the point system and each stage when the idea progress add additional points and certificate. 
Better empowerment for the employee, collaborative and participative management and resolution to the team problem at the root level itself.
