Meet to Innovate 
makes use of the existing diversity and knowledge of employees all over the world. 
the company is present in so many countries however, it is not being used to the benefit of each of them individually. 
create different events, where a group of employees from all COEs meet. Each time, a different COE would be hosting the event. And they would all collaborate through different activities to making the respective COE a better place to work by sharing experience and getting exposed to the different cultures.
the success of the idea would be when employees come up with new ideas through this event and are able to apply it in their COE.
