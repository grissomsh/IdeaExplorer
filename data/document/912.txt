Baby's Day out
How many time we are in a situation where we aren't aware of how many team are there in CS
How many time we would need help from another team but aren't aware whom to contact

Most of the engineer aren't aware of their peers working across different teams belonging to the same business unit. We would have seen them on the floor but would have never had interacted or known personally. Though the employee are aware of their team-mates, but 80% of them aren't aware of what other teams work on. This idea would help employees to get to know each other across teams
An engineer has one day in a year where he would be able to visit all the team in his business unit and get introduced to his peers working in different team
He would be able to get a brief idea on which product they work, how it works
This allows the engineer to have a personal connect with other team-mates and get help from them directly when working on customer issue where both the teams products are involved.
Interaction of employees, which builds a sense of teamwork within and between departments as each employee becomes more aware of what other employees and departments do
Collaboration with personal connect.
Faster solution to the customers
Employees may get skilled at tasks outside the usual parameters of their jobs and thus become greater assets for the company while gaining knowledge and skills that benefit them personally.
