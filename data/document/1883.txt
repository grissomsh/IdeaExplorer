Knowledge sharing sessions open to everyone
Improve communications and knowledge sharing
Once I realized how many people work at the COE and the sheer diversity of backgrounds it was clear that there is a huge untapped resource in our hands.
Regular sessions where people get the opportunity to talk about a topic. It can really be anything but it has to be interesting, they have to be passionate about it, and it has to be something they know know enough about to fill a short presentation.
For me success would be counted in the diversity of people and topics that get presented, and in people feeling like there is a place where they can go and feel heard. The benefits lie in creating a more knowledgeable work force that is engaged in constant learning, feel like they can express themselves, and provide a conduit force making connections across the organization.
