Getting right mind at right place.
Open source involves a lot of mind with diversity. EMC has such brilliant minds which can help build EMC Developer forum for all. We can create forum in which diverse BU contributors can participate. BU's who directly deal with he customer might have much idea to contribute.
I am not sure if this type of forum is available right now. What I am saying is commom platform for all rather than being so specific products forum.

A platform where we could even upload our own projects and seek ideas on different areas/topics.
This platform can bring all diverse minded people with intelligent approach. we might find the right talent and involve him in the right team to develop projects as per customer expectations. 

An open source forum will give an equal opportunity to all employeess across EMC which will ofcourse enrich the product and technology. invotive ideas/ algorithms can be gained from this forum.
We see lot of open source software available. This is nothing but people with common interest coming together and making up the projects.
If same trend is followed in EMC and employees come up to get involved in the projects, it will ofcourse enhance the exisiting technoglogy and products.
Right talent can be found to meet the todays customer and technology demand.

EMC is full of rich and talented mind. May be we just need to put them in right place to gain 99% output:).
