Proactive balance sheet
The challenges is targeting big data and how we can start applying new services to utilize big data and storage solution provided to our customer specially for the banks
The idea came up when i was attending one of the innovation ideas and discussing how we can start providing IOT as a service, i recalled the everyday talk for most of the employees on how the slayer finish and we lose track of our expenses and ends the month in debt state
By using the storage solutions and big data, banks can start analyzing the end user expenses for couple of month, and then start offering a proactive balance sheet for the upcoming month
It will be done in 3 steps
1. Monitor and analyze the current expenses 
2. Measure the rate of each of the expenses 
3. Offer a predictive balance sheet for the upcoming month

The idea will allow EMC not only to offer the storage as Hardware solution, but also to offer a whole package from h/W and S/w solutions for the banks
It will builds up on what we are already offering and strengthen our market position
It will help the end user to save money in addition to start controlling there expenses
