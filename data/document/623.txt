Handover Tool for RSA
In RSA department the WFM at the end of the day sends an e-mail to the team to ask if anyone has a handover, which leads to many e-mails in the Outlook. 

NA
We would like to introduce a new tool: the handover tool.
Everyone will have access to this tool. 
Once an engineer has a turnover, he/she opens the tool and enters all the required details in the tool. 
Another employee from the handover region will open the tool too and check for the newest handover to his/her region. 
The process of handover will run smoothly. 
The engineers will simply open the tool and check for all handover cases.
