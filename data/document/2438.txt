3rd platform Central Hub App for Cultural Digitization @EMC
The Community Challenge is about coming up with a solution for a Mobile App for Cultural Digitization. This idea primarily focusses on,

-	Functional View of the App
-	Proposed Design for the solution
-	Mock ups 

We are a 3rd platform Application Development group in IT, having experiences working on end-to-end Application development primarily using Open Source technologies & developing microservices using Pivotal Cloud Foundry.
Proposal is to build the App using Open Source technologies (mentioned below). 

Functionally the App will be able to perform the below activities,

-	All EMC employees will be authenticated into the App using SSO Authentication
-	When the User logins in, he/she will be able to view a tile of pictures uploaded into the App by all other Users
-	Each User will have a profile page to view all the content, pictures posted & uploaded by him/her
-	Users will be provided with an option to choose the language they would prefer in their profile page
-	The User will be provided with an option to Upload pictures from his/her mobile device ( or a laptop ). User will be provided with an option to provide short description before Upload.
-	The User will be provided with an option to Delete his/her pictures 
-	All Users will be able to Like the posted pictures 
-	The number of Likes against a post will be displayed ( as in facebook )
-	User will be able to search pictures using keywords
-	Social enablement for the App, so users will be provided with an option to share the pictures on Facebook & Twitter ( also any intranet site like Inside EMC, based on the access given to us )

Technology Stack 

The solution can be implemented using 3rd platform micro services architecture using pivotal cloud foundry. The proposed technology stack involves developing a 3rd platform compatible, responsive web application with below components.

-	Responsive bootstrap UI for cross device compatibility ( can be used in both laptop, iOS, Android & other mobile devices as well) & Jquery for front end development ( along with HTML, CSS, Ajax )
-	Use REST API backend development using Spring MVC 
-	My SQL for database
-              Application can be wrapped using Open Source Mobile SDKs for a Native Look & Feel
-              Developed microsservices can be hosted on the IT Pivotal Cloud Foundry for easier deployments and maintenance of the App
-              The mobile App can be hosted on the EMC App Store

The mock ups are located at Inside EMC for quick view of look & feel of the App -

This solution provides cross device compatibility. Can be used both in laptop & all mobile devices (including iOS, Android, Windows etc.)

Scalable architecture using 3rd platform solutions.
