Voice to Text Entry and Voice Command Recognition- EMC Mobile Apps 

From our knowledge of the EMC Support App Development, we feel that this added functionality will improve the total customer experience when they perform such tasks as 
1)	Adding a New Note, 
2)	Changing Status, 
3)	Creating a new Service Request.
Not only can Voice Recognition be used for text entry, but also for Command Initiation as in: “New Note”

By integrating Voice to text capabilities users will be able to add text and initiate tasks more easily. This enhanced interaction will likely result in both customer delight and productivity.
