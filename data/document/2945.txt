Mainframe: CLAY IDE as client workplace
idea is Mainframe-specific, therefore I am expecting to have some challenges devoted to Mainframe.
Currently, simple FTP pluguns for VIM editor are functioning just fine, allowing user edit files, compare/update versions of a file, submit a job and receive result into the same workplace, or just into PC local filesystem.
This approach makes it possible to use any preferable editor for programming on mainframe.
What needs to be done is to replace FTP approach with a specialised service program, which will solve the problem.
Traditionally, clients on z/OS connect using telnet protocol which emulates 3270 terminal. This makes possible to use only limited range of tools that exist on z/OS, e.g. there is no alternate editor except which is provided by ISPF. CLAY session is even worse. 
I suggest to develope a simple server program that connects to some traditional IDE on PC (e.g. Eclipse or any other configurable IDE) which will allow to execute any actions on CLAY (or Mainframe)
Users of mainframe and CLAY users will have convenient developer or user workplace. Proof-of-concept implementation exists (which uses FTP)
