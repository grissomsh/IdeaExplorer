Reveal potential customers for PivotalTracker: CTD VNX, and GPO that have applied Agile in daily workflow.
Annoyed by Rally, I decided to poke around and found PivotalTracker which is definitely superior!
- Replace Rally with PivotalTracker!
- A short list of PivotalTracker strengths that beat Rally
    a. Concise and well organized GUI, less fields, faster speed! (Rally editing has high overhead)
    b. Mobile capability with consistent user experience, yes Go Mobile!
    c. One place management of Backlog, Icebox, Epic and Stories with customized side menu
    d. Vivid colors and Intuitive Icons which you are already familiar with and you could get started immediately
    e. Use product from your own company!
- Engineers productivity would be boosted by saving time, tedious editing and frustrations
- EMC would save money by not paying Rally
- Prevent potential leaking of confidential technology or data
- PivotalTracker gains more popularity and market share
