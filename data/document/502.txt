5 days under the poverty line mobile app
Make an application to raise funds by the users and direct it to many community involvement activities.
I thought about the poor people and how we -as EMC- help them, and spread the awareness about it in a global way. In the same time show EMC accountability towards the local communities. The program will not cost EMC any thing as the employees will only donate the difference between what they consume on the food for 5 days, and the 1.5 $/day for the food.

this will increase the awareness of EMC employees about the needy community like the clean water initiative.
I suggest that we can do a mobile app as an initiative within EMC to encourage our Employees and their families " Except children" to try to live 5 days under the poverty line. We can live actually with 1.5 $/day for 5 days. We can calculate our food consumption average for 5 days, and after living with 1.5 $/day for 5 days, we can donate the difference. We can apply it in all the countries we are operating in as a responsibility towards the society.  This will show how EMC has society accountability, and how can we contribute to fight hanger, and participate in many community involvement activities across the world on all EMC branches.

I prepared a manual of the program and how can we proceed with it.
1- though the app we can calculate the total in progress users.
2- Funds collected by each country to be directed to "community involvement" activities.
3- Funds can be used for the annual activities of the community involvement initiatives like the "Clean water" one which is crucial and I liked it to much.
