Daycare Center

This idea came up when I started to realize a few of my friends who had just given births, how hard it was for them to balance between her personal and work life. Its exhausting and it may have caused negative side effects on her work roles.
This idea would help so many mothers to be able to balance their work life and new born babies. Its hard for a mother to be able to work, take care of a new born child and keep up with her personal life. This idea will help mothers keep their jobs and be able to pursue all work responsibilities without excuses or having to affect her job negatively. This idea is basically a daycare center where mothers can leave their babies/children with highly trained and trusted professionals. This daycare center would be located at EMC premises where a mother would be able to check over her child at any given time.
