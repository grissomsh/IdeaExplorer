Regular Internships For Young Talents  
This will serve the below two selected challenges best. 
I personally know some young and very promising talents that would like to peruse opportunities abroad and know very little of what we do here. 

We want to keep them here and make them realize how they can contribute. 
Internship opportunities and shadowing should be offered to promising young talents still in school/collage. This will be done through the university relation coordinator and the HR departments. 

We will provide certificates at the end of the internship period. 
Will generate new ideas.
Young talents will have an idea what is EMC and what we do.
Will help attract a great pool of candidates. 
Will participate in growing the society. 
EMC will have young talents to help at zero cost.
