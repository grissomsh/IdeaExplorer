Integrating Webcast feature into Lync

Found youtube has the webcast feature for live events, then came up with the idea. 
If we integrate Webcast feature into Lync, we can attend events like "EMC world" or join any tech talk remotely, which is definitely an beneficial experience enhancement for EMC employees.
