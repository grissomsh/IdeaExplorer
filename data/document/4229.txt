Enhanced knowledge center support via online tool and mobile app.

We have faced similar issues in EMC IT and several CSI initiatives have been driven to improve TCE and efficiency.
Mobile App to include: 
Library which will have all support documents, recent issues and its resolution,
Warranty status - Current status of the services and if any offer on warranty,
New product launches and New Mergers & Acquisitions,
Creation of SR in mobile application can be considered as well.

News Feed (on products and services)can be incorporated in the mobile app and the online tool based on "whats trending in Facebook EMC page and Twitter EMC page".

Data analysis can be performed based on the existing customer queries: 

How many specific issues are logged by customer and the Number of occurrences - which will help us improve the product and services.

Feedback on support docs can be included to both mobile app and online tool:
