Meet me around the world

I always wonder how other offices look like or how people working in other countries seem. Email and telephones don’t really reveal the person you are usually dealing with. This could help us understand different cultures and people around the globe


Using Wi-Fi and a simple camera should help implement this idea everywhere. If a person wants to talk to someone in another country he/she could just go to the area where it’s set up and chat about EMC details or random things from culture difference or even the weather. This give employees to meet more diverse employees somewhere around the globe, it could even end up as a quick call in front of the webcam with coffee talking about a current deal two employees are working on.
