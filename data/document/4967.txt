Dynamic storage activity monitoring based on usage frequency.

I talked this with my colleague Xiao, Pan. We both think this could improve user's operation.
Enable a mechanism/algorithm based on usage frequency. This method could analyze and record user's usage habit.
After that, we can caculate the top N opeartion, summary them to a shortcut on management GUI(Unisphere). Next time, user could easily go to target operation without additional opertion.

E.g. In current Rockies, if you want to check Lun compression summary. You need following operations.
1. Open Unisphere;
2. Go to "Storage" tab;
3. Move mouse to left panel;
4. Select "Select Lun Summary", and view the summary.

The same operations for "Deduplication" and "Migration" summary.
If we abstract this to a shortcut, these operation will be one step only. It will be much easiler for user.
We also could apply this in "report" area.
