EMC Indoor Navigation.

This idea it came when we were working on App-i-licious Fest EMC India COE Mobility Event contest.
Initially we came out with a small story write-up for the idea.
Story-
-Once upon a time there lived an employee in EMC.
-One day the employee’s manager set up an important meeting in a conference room 
-When the meeting invite popped up from his outlook, he jumped out from his seat and set out in finding the conference room.
-He searched every nook and corner of his floor. But he couldn’t locate the room
-He searched the floors above and the floors below. No luck
-Then, he called the help desk and got to know that ‘the conference room’ is in the other block 
-Desperate to attend the meeting on time, he dashed to the other block, only to find that it was again a scary maze 
-When he finally reached the conference room, he realized that the meeting was overdue by an hour.
