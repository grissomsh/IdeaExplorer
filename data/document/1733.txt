Make SYMAPI DB/SYMM performance database as open format
Today many customers are writing scripts for customization by querying the SYMAPI DB. this DB is in proprietary format and need SYMCLI client to work. The idea is to make this DB as generic DB structure and expose in API interface. So public can write various drivers for their platform like Java, C#, .NET , C,C++ etc.also existing reporting tools can connect to this DB using these drivers and query the DB. instead of specific SYMCLI commands, the generic SQL query can be applied. example if we expose the DB tables/collections for TDEV devices, then query will be "Select * from TDEV"  which can return all the thin devices instead of SYMAPI command. so we don't need solution enabler client and with driver and DB in offline existing development platforms and reporting tools can leverage this SYMAPI DB and do the analytics. All these prosperity databases including the STP data ect Should be made as open format.  
when working with team internally, many teams are writing symapi query commands and spending lot of time on parsing the XML output by running with SE client. If we have some JDBC/ODBC support then they can simply connect and slice/dice their reports.
Right now there is no PoC or any steps taken. It is in idea stage and the relevant team should work and make it for public consumption.This is applicable to performance(STP) data etc. if we have such DB driver connectivity, a simple Java program can connect to the DB and query the tables and use existing reporting libraries/routines/UI to display the results.Also 3rd party reporting companies/ETL can extend their products to write such new connectors for this SYMM DB platform.Also any mobile platform using this driver can write apps for their platform and SYMAPI reports can be generated in Mobile platform.
the success can reduce lot of SYMAPI customer's time (understanding the existing SYMAPI commands) and money spending on this report development.
