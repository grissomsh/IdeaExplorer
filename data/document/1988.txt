Smart DECT Phones
Most of us require and carry a DECT phone. Apart from being a simple mobile phone, it doesn't give any other benefit.
Idea was generated thru a local IGS with the Process Eng group.
Current SMART Photos do all of the above! Introduce newer DECT phones that are similar to or are like SMART phones. It allows local access to printers, photos and alerts on meetings etc. Yes employees with EMC approved devices have some of this but most folks don't have them. A SMART DECT phone can solve this.
Enhance employee productivity, people would be alerted to meetings. Improves access to required technologies like printing and highlighting issues and defects visually quickly and efficiently.
Allows employees to manage their work better thus improving organisational side of their day to day business.
Leverages the technologies in place already.
