Order Online Sandwich Counter
Improvement of a service Ireland COE
Talking about innovation during lunchtime. 
An online system to pre-order from the sandwich counter using an online portal hosted on the EMC internal network. 

User can use the service to choose bread type, protein and salad fillings and put in an order and specify desired collection time before going to lunch.

The order will be linked to the users employee name and employee number.

A user will select a desired collection time from a list of available times and pick up the finished sandwich from the collection area in the canteen at that time.

In the canteen there would be a collection point with the user's employee name and number displayed on his/her meal. 

Reduce queue times for employees. Allow lunch staff to prepare sandwiches ahead of time. 

It could be expanded after to cater for salads and other foods types. Possibly in future allowing employees more control over their food after expanding the service
