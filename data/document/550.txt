Cultural digitization using crowd sourcing techniques and its life cycle management process (Mobile POC to be completed soon)
The solution to the challenge provides for building a mobile application and a platform which can help cultural digitization using crowd sourcing concept. Further the challenge brings out the complete life cycle management of the digital content.
Idea was generated while brainstorming with Amitabh & Pawan for Innovation conf-2015. 
Our proposal is to provide solution to the five phases of digital content life cycle:
 
* Capture –  Create a mobile application which can capture(and view) digital content and 
  tag them with relevant information 
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
  + The mobile application can detect and tag geo location as meta-data information of 
     the digital content.
  + A user can also create custom tagging on the digital content for automatic 
    cataloguing.(if no tagging is mentioned, a tag is auto generated for the user)
  + The digital content is uploaded automatically to a central server in cloud for 
    further processing. The back end can be based on any of EMC’s cloud storage 
    technologies.

* Automatic Cataloguing  – Based on the tagging done in the previous step, and the 
  metadata of the content; the system will automatically organise the content according 
  to some meaningful ontology. This will facilitate crowd-sourced refinement and curation 
  in the next phase.
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   + Some examples of the catalogue entries could be:
       o   Various cultural events:
           - By manually creating an event (with a location & time information).
             Ex: The event created (Oktoberfest) have attributes of time (late 
             September to the first weekend in October ) and  location (Ex: Munich, 
             Bavaria, Germany).
           - By creating events through automation – using  text analytics & machine 
             learning algorithms on News Paper content.
             (Ex: Analyzing cultural events in every city).
       o   Location of cultural significance:
           - Create a repository of locations of cultural significance (Geo coordinates 
             used for tagging. Ex: Rushmore mountain - 43°52?44.21?N 103°27?35.37?W).
   + The digital content captured & catalogued in STEP A. is run through the set of 
     (catalogue) rules and is checked for close match of meta-data.
   + With the matching meta-data, digital content will be moved to specific pre-existing 
     collections. If a collection does not exist, based on tagging, a new collection is 
     created.

* Curation –  Crowd sourced Identification of digital content that has significant value.
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is done through an online portal where users can rate, tag and categorize or refine automatic tags/metadata on the content.

    + The ratings are assigned to digital content based on:
       o Based on user’s reputation.
       o Based on ratings given by other users.
    + Gamification techniques will be used to encourage users to participate and rate 
      content.The platform will include a system of rewards for the users based on the 
      media content uploaded & reviewed.Based on the points garnered by the users, they 
      will be awarded titles. (Preservation - Basic, Intermediate, Expert).
    + The application will have option to do  ‘like’ and ‘share’ of digital content. 
      Based on the popularity of the digital content, the value of digital content is 
      increased.

      Ex: Based on number of likes & shares, the value and ‘Life Time’ of the digital 
      content can be increased.

* Storage of content
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    + Based on the value of the digital content, further storage decisions are made on:
         o   Storage of the content:  Based on the value of the digital content, 
             decisions where/how to store, organize the content are taken.

             Ex: Based on the importance the digital content is stored on relevant 
             storage tiers (SSD v/s mechanical disks v/s archival storage)

         o   Fidelity of the content stored:
             - Based on the value of the digital content, the quality of the digital  
               content to be stored is decided.
               Ex: A full HD digital content with medium/low value will be converted to 
                   Low HD;A 16 MB photo with medium/low value will be converted to  4MB.
         o   Replica copies of the content: If a rare copy of cultural digitization is 
             created (high value), it will be copied on multiple locations for extra 
             protection.   
         o   Archival decision of the content:
             -  If the value of digital content is important only in near future, the 
                content will be archived.
         o   Life Time of the content: 
             -  If a digital content is found to of low value, life time of the content 
                will be set appropriately


* Consumption
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
         o   The user will use the app to browse & share digital content. Search/ browse 
             features will allow users to slice and dice content based on time, tags, geo 
             location, ratings etc.
         o   The application would be written multilingual support in mind.


The solution at the end of it would have a mobile/web application and backend to maintain the life cycle of digitization project.
