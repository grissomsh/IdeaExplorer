Virtual global teams/groups creation
by Appling this model we will be sure that we are getting diversity of thinking to achieve a same goal using innovation, as well we can mix and match different people from different countries and teams with different background and experiences all over th
I came up with the idea when they announce volunteers to join for innovation program committee in Egypt this time and after I became a member and meet my team which is composed of different employees from different teams in EMC Egypt. I realized that different experiences and backgrounds can be really effective to complete a whole picture, and then I was thinking why not to do so in a bigger scale like globally. it might be very effective specially now we are having a lot of ways to meet even when we are not in the same place.
The idea is to build a cross functional Matrix groups or teams, composed of virtual team whose members are from different teams across EMC global.

this team will be assigned to resolving a productissue, work on a program/project on assignment and will make use of the diverse skills from EMC employees across the world.

The process of forming this team is:

1- The board will announce/initiate the new assignment globally by sending it all EMC employees.

2- Employees will send their CVs and well managers can nominate adequate calibers.

3- The committee conducts interviews using the most suitable channel and send the selection for members and leaders as well.

4- Teams will then announced and start working together aiming same goals with different background and experiences.

To insure we get the best quality for the work done add some competition, more than one team will work on the same initiative and the team with the best output will get a rewards
It can be the most effective way to collect people from different experiences and backgrounds versus an ordinary team with same experiences and ideas.
