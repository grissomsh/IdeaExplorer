Solution for massive documents generated by wearable devices

We have a lot of innovation ideas about easing content management, like ideas 2012000789, 2013003944. 
Along with Goolge Glass into the market, we felt it's urgent/chance/chanllenge/market to provide content management system for them. 
NGIS is not a simple cloud driver again iCloud/GoogleDriver/SkyDriver. It has not only abilities of traditional CMS, like Content Server, ease the management of massive documents, such as version, search, folder, tag, recommendation, image processing, format converting. But it's lightweight for personal purpose, no hardware management, no software adminstration, 24*7 service.

So the idea is that we can provide NGIS service to personal usage(or as CloudFoundry service) and provide clients for wearable devices. Like the intention of NGIS, we need to grasp the next generation in advance.
