"Apply It" Tool
This is a process we go through daily that can be easily automated and optimized for a higher efficiency,
Being a member in the Remote Proactive team, I always work on multiple SRs for the same customer and some times the number of SRs can be 10+ where I have to open each SR separately and log the same note that for example says (Initial Contact)
My solution is "Apply It" a tool that allows engineers to apply the change they want to multiple SRs at the same time with one click.

How it works:
The tool to be downloaded and linked to the employee's support.emc profile by simple login page.

Features:
- Service Request Numbers -2 digits number- (That auto populate the customer site name for assurance)
- The change they wish to apply (a similar view to the service center)

Changes that can be applied to all:
- New Note Logging 
- SR Status
- SR Owner
- SR Owner Group
- NCC (next customer contact)

**After clicking submit, the change will be applied to all mentioned SRs
Having a tool that applies to all (NCC, logging notes,...etc) will
- Save time
- Increase Efficiency
- Minimize confusion and mistakes of SR handling
- Project efficiency to customers who check the SRs and find them organised and clear
