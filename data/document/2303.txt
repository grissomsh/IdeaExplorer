Advanced Evaluation of Customer Needs
EMC hosts 1000's of meetings with customer each year. This proposal will leverage the feedback shared by our customers combined with salesforce.com account, and external industry data to increase our revenue opportunities, improve the relevancy of our messaging, and reduce the cost to identify revenue opportunities through application of data analytics'.
Over the past three quarters reviewing the CTO Ambassador customer feedback reports customer provide clear indications of their EMC offering interest and often identify new sales opportunities. Feedback reports are available at: https://inside.emc.com/groups/cto-ambassadors/projects/2015-q1-meeting-feedback

Our solution will access existing data sources including Salesforce, industry data services such as Crush, EBC briefing profiles, and CTO ambassador feedback reports to access the customers profile, and EMC sentiment to predict the EMC Federation products and services they are most likely to purchase. With the help of E2E Horizon team we can implement data analysis and help target our sales campaigns and optimize our predictive models. See https://inside.emc.com/docs/DOC-155438
Our definition of success would be to identify and verify sales opportunities using predictive analytic models that would increase EMC revenue in the accounts that visited the EBC or field briefing program. Our success will be measured by % increase in new sales opportunity as measured through Salesforce account plan after meeting with us.
