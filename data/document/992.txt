ESXi hosts for each CS BU 
Making use of IT resources and enhancing the daily operations for each TSE.
Having troubles running large amount of VMs on our laptops as resources aren't enough
Model:
#######
-Each BU will have their ESXi hosts and access will be granted from each manager to the employees if needed.

-Employees will have the ability to create/host their own virtual machines on the ESXi hosts.

-Employees will be able to reach out to specific team in case there is something wrong with network configuration or access.


Important points to be taken into consideration:
#################################################
-Not all CS BU requires virtual environment or labs so each manager has to check with his BU before requesting number of ESXis

-Virtual machines will have grace period in order not to run out of space (Something like 3-5 months for each new implemented VM).
-Saving employees time
-Utilizing lab resources
-Making it easy to reproduce customer's issues
-Decreasing TTR
