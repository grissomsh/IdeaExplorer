Blockchain(Open ledger) based security for IOT devices
Helps in secure communication of IOT devices
While exploring different apps built on of blockchain technology.
A block chain is a distributed data store that holds a public ledger of transactions for cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin. This record is enforced cryptographically and hosted on machines running the software. ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_chain_%28database%29). Blockchain could be used by IOT devices to track other devices & their relationship with other devices. IBM is trying in similar lines.
