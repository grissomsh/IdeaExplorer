Single pass VM backup with  MS applications
Need to perform backup twice for Recovery of Exchange ,Sql,Sharepoint installed in VM Environment (Avamar and Networker)

Found customers complaining about the Backup Window 
1>VM backup
2> Application backup
Developing single VSS provider that does the VM and Application consistent backup , so no need to perform the backup twice and when we restore it should restore everything backup

It would Reduce the backup window , as well as save restore time and make customer satisfied
