Modern way to gain customer insight 
I think my idea matches the challenge as it address gaining customer experience, pull on social media and additionally looking at improvement of workplace for the future and enhancing collaboration.  
Social media now contains great deal of company adverts every second. I think rewarding customers for giving EMC information is the best way to gain accurate data as they have an incentive to fill of registration form. This registration form will be completed for the customer logs onto the game, this form contains questions such as , rating overall customer experience, likes/ dislikes of EMC experience and what they would change.    
I propose an idea that looks at offering customers awards based on participation on social media activities. On EMC social media sites, customers can enter into a short daily game where they receive points, these points add up and can be used to redeem money off local services. Once customers enter into this game, they must register their details which will help gain customer insight. Additionally, this game can be multi-players system which enablers partners and their employees to play the game in groups. This will help improve collaboration. 
I hope this idea will entice customers to participate and thus in turn generate customer database for EMC. I also hope that it will highlight some of the important changes that need to be made in order to create the workplace of the future.
