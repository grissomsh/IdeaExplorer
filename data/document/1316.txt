COE Ireland as a collaborative workspace
This is for the COE Ireland challenge. This idea addresses the removal of physical, geographical and technical silos.
Many of the ideas came from an Innovation day (CTD Technology day) run recently to discuss EMC products and look at innovation as a function of the the workplace.
This is unique in that it would not be department specific, creating a truly 'centrally minded' work environment.
A success would be a central repository for information, ideas, and product documentation of a COE or EMC wide level.
