Engage My Community
We believe this idea will: -
1. Improve communication with employees across the COE and Federation, locally and globally
2. Allow employees to collaborate globally to share ideas, tips etc
3. Increase employees knowledge of how to use social media tools
The three of us are part of the Ireland COE Social Medial Steering Committee and see a need to provide further support for employees interested in Social Media. While there is Social Media University available for employees to learn social media there is no real follow-up or guidance once the courses are completed.
Create a group on Inside EMC where tips, articles, links and how to guides are provided as well as real time feedback to any questions posted, we believe employees will become more comfortable using social media tools and will therefore start to engage and collaborate more and thereby become more ready for being social and mobile for the 3rd platform.
As employees engage more it increases the visibility of the EMC brand and will show that EMC is walking the talk through embracing 3rd platform technology and becoming a more social brand through employee advocacy.
