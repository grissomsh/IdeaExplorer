Queue mechanism among product change tracking system

This isn't that new idea and just think it is would be useful for us from my past experience and improve the efficency here, i.e. tracking AR (VNX product codes) / OPT (FW/HW issue).
Construct queue/bridge DB and implementing the plugins among the involved change tracking systems and implement the queue/map relationship in the bridge/queue DB.
