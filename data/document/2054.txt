Creating a New World through EMC 
My idea relates to the challenge as it address issues concerning workplace of the future. I hope to propose an idea that highlights what the workplace might look like in 20-50 years time. My idea is also aimed at improving communication among employees and thus limiting confusion.   
I came up with this idea through numerous occasions of double bookings rooms. 
My solution is to create electronic wireless notice board within each department/ floor that will address some of the problems outlined. This notice board will look at which employees are attending certain meeting, the times they are attending and the rooms where it will take place. This highlights to managers the free time that the employee might have to meet there manager. Additionally, it highlights which rooms are booked in order to prevent confusion and double bookings. This notice board will the linked to email system already used in EMC so the data can be electronic generated with very little manual involvement. 
I hope that this idea will create less confusion within departments and furthermore enhance efficiency. Additionally, I hope this idea will improve communication within EMC as employees will be aware of other employees free time.
