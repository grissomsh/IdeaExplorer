Log server
Logs of the all events are stored under particular server 
Very tough to login and check the logs of the server if number of server, storage array is located in a particular network and very tough to grab those logs all time we need to run the script to collect the log which is most time consuming.
We can install FLUME software in all assets, storage, server, switch.. etc
And every time the generated logs are sent to FLUME server which is located remotely.
We can reduce the work load, easily and fast collection of the logs, easy and fast analysis of the logs
