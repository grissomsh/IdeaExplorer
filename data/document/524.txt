Employee Innovation Forum
By creating this forum at EMC this will encourage any employee interested in innovating to be able to get help from others who have innovated before. This will be a diverse group of folks from all over the world. Each of the emc offices around the world can have a local chapter. 
This idea came about reading the HR challenge and being part of a few of the diversity circles here at EMC and enjoying the benefits of the group. We think this will definitely help the employees to foster innovation. Currently we have this Innovation roadmap challenge once a year. By starting this forum which will be throughout the year any employee who wants to innovate and needs help fostering their ideas  will have a group to support them.
We would like to propose creating a forum similar to the employee circles that we have in EMC and meet weekly or bi-weekly. This would help members of the forum to have a regular meetup time to discuss and foster their ideas.We would also invite innovators from within EMC and outside to talk to the members of the forum. Once ideas mature we can submit to the Innovation Challenge. This forum can have a library with books, dvds, etc. that are relevant. Give guidance to employees on different opportunities to attend conferences on innovation. This forum will be open to anyone in EMC and a local champion can open chapters and conduct regular meetings. 
If this forum is created this can definitely increase the innovation within EMC. This will encourage to grow and innovate within the company. New products can be developed and create a revenue stream. This will provide a place where employees with early stage ideas can get help to bring it to completion.
