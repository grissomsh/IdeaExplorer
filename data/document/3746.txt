GPTW – COPYING BEST PRACTICES

Brainstorming
Currently for all the Questions concerning Credibility, Respect, Fairness, Pride & Camaraderie there are managers within EMC who may score as less as 0 to as good as 100. It may have remained the same over the years or may have also changed either for good or bad.

For any given question under a particular category, we can segregate a good number of managers with diverse backgrounds, workgroups, & nature of jobs who would have scored top scores consistently. We then do a deep dive to understand the top five reasons why people would have scored them more than anybody else…then we get a list of top five reasons/competencies why people would score someone more for every question in the GPTW survey.

Using this Top Five Reasons, we can plan/design training and development programs for all the other managers across the Organization and make it as a must have competency/behavior for them…then, we can truly replicate the best practices from the best of managers across EMC to the rest of managers across EMC we can replicate the top scores for all managers from our workforce and make EMC a Greater Place to Work.
