EMC Federation Product information portal  
This idea addresses the Ireland COE Challenge by allowing EMC business units and federation partners to communicate and collaborate with EMC employees and COE Ecosystem through a learning platform/app.
The team has experience collaborating with many EMC's BUs and product teams as part of our core business, and has very little exposure to wider EMC federation. 
This challenge identified an opportunity to collaborate, communicate and make connections with EMC BUs and Federation partners. 
Our central portal solution provides the ability for employees to make connections between EMC business units and Federation partners to share and request information. 
*BUs and Federations partners can create their product or solution overviews and demos to allow employees understand EMC offered solutions
*An employee can request an overview of existing or new product/solution from BUs and Federation partners
*An employee can browse the portal for available training and overview modules to develop their understanding on EMC's products/platforms and solutions 
*Some modules may be used for new hire training or as a new technology vision for teams working with specific product/solution.
*Ability for employees to see technology trends and understand industry requirements
*Great EMC BU and Federation collaboration opportunity though one central place

This portal would become a central location for product/solution information, vision and strategy sharing, addressing collaboration and communication challenge across EMC BUs and Federation partners.

Benefits: this is a win, win, winâ€¦
*Win for the Ireland COE: 
*Win for EMC Federation partners: 
*Win for employees:
