Multipath on Switches
It's a disruptive for current mutipath softeware.
Currently, we have many multipath vendors with different versions for different OS platform. Configurations on hosts are complex and time-consuming. If we can centralize the variety steps on a core device such as switch, it will definitely reduce the TCO.
1.	Install a multipath plug-in into switches;
2.	Configure zoning as usual;
3.	Multipath plug-in retrieves information from hosts and storage array. 
4.	Multipath plug-in set up virtual paths on switches between corresponding host port and storage port automatically.
5.	Perform multipath management tasks on switches just like PowerPath on hosts.

It will improve customer satisfaction
