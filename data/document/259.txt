Enhance SYR Centera Health Reports
The idea aims at enhancing the user experience as well as realizing cost and time saving in handling Centera requests by IBG as well as other teams 
The idea came to me while working on a cleanup of a huge Centera cluster in the Install Base and having to figure this information manually instead of having it automatically added to the Health Report 
Work with IT/BTG, CLM/SYR team as well Engineering to enhance the data that calls home in SYR by Centera clusters.
An extra field would be required in the Health Report to Identify the Serial Number of the Base TLA where each et of Nodes belong
Once completed, this will provide a better visibility on all Centera clusters for all concerned entities as well as reduce the man hours required by IBG to uncover and update the required information I IB
