Desktop as a Service (DaaS)
Utilizing resources and making everything virtualized
VDI
Brief:
-By using the resources in Durham Lab, We can remove the headache of infrastructure issues.

-This will help IT units to be able to handle issues quickly through using a centralized cloud platform.

-It will also save money because we won't need to spend money buying new laptops with high qualifications every while or replacing one of the broken devices with new one


Implementation:
-Each employee will have thin client on their laptops/desktops that connects through ip portal to access their Windows OS.

-Portal can be accessed through tablets also to make it more handy if the employee is outside the office.
Making it easy for employees to use virtual environment
