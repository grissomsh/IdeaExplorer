Virtual EMC Ideation Centers
To make the best use of and take advantage of the gender and ethnic diversity of talent currently at EMC
I am a part of some of the Google Groups and there anybody can post any challenge with respect to a particular subject and anyone from anywhere else who is part of this Google Group can post a solution and I've seen it working really well.
My idea is to create Virtual EMC Ideation Centers either through EMC Website or a Mobile App where any EMC employee can put up a challenge and some other EMC employee/s elsewhere can contribute with a solution for the same. If the solution saves time/money/effort for the one who posted the challenge s/he can go ahead and reward or recognize the other employee whose Idea worked. With time we'll be able to get the people across the organization who are up for any challenge thats coming up across the globe and also influence others to follow this path for a better job satisfaction and change the Organization culture as well.
