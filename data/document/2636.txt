Build a Smart Road System for a Smart City
Using EMC technologies to help designing roads in the new smart city
It would be easier if organizations that were most visited by people are on wide roads
Using networking, data storage and data analytic technologies, we store the number of people that can visit a specific place ( whether governmental organizations, multinational companies providing customer services, etc )  and help to design the roads due to the predictions made ( to optimize the city road system and how they are implemented in order to avoid crowded places )
Using EMC technologies to help enhance the style of living would be a good marketing for EMC, optimizing a city road system that would make it easy for people to access governmental organizations or to get a specific service without wasting time in traffi
