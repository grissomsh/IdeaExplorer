"network analyzer as a service" for Hybrid Cloud
Network traffic analyzing is very important for IT system daily operation,monitoring, troubleshooting. Network analyzing tools such as WireShark are widely used in traditional physical network.
When building EHC solution, we found it is difficult to troubleshooting the cloud network issue. So, I decide to develop such tool.
In this ideal, the solution will try to solve above issue based on WireShark:
1, Implementing network packet capture process in virtual network environment;
2, Automating the packet capture operation process;
3, Integrating with hybrid cloud, define "network analyzing" as a self-service catalog in cloud portal;

If the idea is fully implemented, it can be packaged as a tool for all hybrid cloud admin . And if this solution works fine, more traditional network tools(such as scanner,DPI) can be integrate into this solution. And make it a  useful toolbox for cloud admin.
