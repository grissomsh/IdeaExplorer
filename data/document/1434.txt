EMC Space (100% PoC  with video demo )
Community Involvement Challenge: Developed an android app which helps EMC employees in crowdsourcing. 
It is our new idea. We already have the experience of developing prototype. We thought, with the knowledge of Android, we could do this. 
So we had a initial brainstorming to have simple and user-friendly interface which could leverage EMC resources. We redefined our idea as and when required and finally came up with a solution satisfying all needs.
