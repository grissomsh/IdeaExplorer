Queue Management
Change in SQC EMEA Queue Management
Experienced too much load of work, complicated requests and time consuming when trying to get information from SE's. This will help balance out the workload and the equality between straight-forward and complicated requests.
My solution is to merge the queues together so that everyone will get a fair share of open requests.
It will be successful when:
1- Requests are treated FIFO: First in first out
2- Everyone will work on all available regions
3- Requests will be distributed evenly between team members
4- More learning opportunities for all team members
