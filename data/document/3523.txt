 Log to GUI translator â€“ easier and consistent troubleshooting

 The idea came up from the daily log analysis tasks that take huge time and effort 
 The idea works on automating the process of combining information from different log files together and form a GUI representation of the current array setup that will help investigating the issues especially performance issues.
For example, in VNXe logs carry information about :

-	Filesystems created
-	Storage servers created
-	What silesystems reside on which server
-	Host access to different filesystems
-	How filesystems are spread into the storage pools
-	Disk and raid level configuration

All these information are spread into different text files and are difficult to extract. The GUI translator tool will extract all information and display a hierarchical representation of the storage configuration that will help the TSEs.
