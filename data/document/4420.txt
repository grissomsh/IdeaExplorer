Talent Mapping

I was reviewing the employee satisfaction with in my team and I felt everyone is having unique skills. Everyone wants to pursue different career goals. They want to get in to different roles. I believe this Talent Mapping process will give them an oppurtunity to allign themselves to the career path what they are looking for.
Lets create a Talent Mapping process, Identify the team member's strenghts and map it with the team, roles & and responsibilities which best suits their strength. Later they can collaborate with those teams or work on projects. This will help in having more engaged & productive employees.
