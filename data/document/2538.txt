memcached / redis hosted on the XtremIO nodes
Merge XtremIO AFA with 3rd platform databases (key-value stores)
Thought about it after reading a bit on memcached.
As XtremIO is running Linux, it is very feasible to run some containers directly on the nodes. The possibility of running containers with either memcached or redis key-value store database is particularly interesting, for several reasons:

- We already have an active-active scale-out cluster (the XtremIO cluster as a whole).

- They can easily share memory (via the RDMA infra.)

- They can store their data on the XtremIO directly.
