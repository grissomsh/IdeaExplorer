Escalated SR Contact
This idea will support better communication with the Support team for the Escalated cases.
Sometimes when i escalate cases and check the owner of the Case i find that the name in the Service center is different from his name on Lync.
My Solution is to Add a chat button on the Service Center when a support take an ownership for a case ,we can contact him directly.
1-Easier communication with the support.
2-Better level of service for the Customers.
