On-Site Doctor
Enhancing the environment towards a great place to work.
We have been seeing people getting sick and fainting down in company while no one is available to assist them.

Doctor is usually coming on-site for couple of hours twice which isn't enough
Having full time on site doctor to assist employees in case one of them is sick
Taking care of employees
Increasing employees satisfaction
