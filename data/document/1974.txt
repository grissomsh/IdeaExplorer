Social application 
The challenge I have discovered is that of lack of communication between different sites and different EMC departments. Employees are therefore left unaware of events being held and this leads to lack of communication and collaboration between departments. I feel this idea is very relevant to Ireland COE challenge. 
I discovered this problem when other departments were hosting events that I would have like to attend. Often employees are unaware of team events that are taking place because of lack of communication. 
My idea is to have an EMC Social app where departments post team events, outings and parties. All employees can then view this team sessions. Employees can accept/ reject the events if they can attend. This process is similar to booking meeting on outlook emails but this platform would be only for social outings. Additionally, this app would be interactive and contain a jokes and humorous quotes in order to brighten employees days. The application would be very easy to use in order to lot of people downloading it.  
I would hope that this application would increase awareness of social outing and furthermore boost attendance at EMC outings. I also hope that the app would boost employees moral and esteem needs as they would be invited and have access to lots of social events in work.Additionally, as members attend outings they would get to know each other better and thus improving future collaboration and communication between departments.
