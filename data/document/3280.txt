Quote of the Day!

I like writing quotes and thinking about them through me life, so that's why I thought of this idea.
There will be a bulletin board at the entrance of floor, where someone can just write a quote of the day. All the quotes will be gathered during the month and people will vote on the most affective quote of the month.
