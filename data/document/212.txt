"Digitize It"
This idea will help in digitizing cultural heritages by offering a crowd sourcing platform and mobile app
This idea came up as my colleagues and myself decided to brainstorm and combine our efforts and thoughts to get better ideas for this year's innovation conference.
Our idea is to develop a platform where EMC offers a customized application that connects cultural heritage providers with employees who are willing to give to the community and contribute with their efforts to digitize the information.

Platform:
The platform where EMC is the admin is open for reactive and proactive requests to the app.

*Reactive:
Heritage providers to create profiles where they log the below information:
- username / password
- First Name
- Last Name
- Phone
- E-mail
- Organization
- Title in organization

After they get the confirmation they can submit an app request where they will be directed to choose the existing template or create a customized one from scratch:
--Template:
- App Name
- Organization Name (imported from profile)
- Organization Location
- Logo
- History
- How many users will access this application
- Platform Support (IOS, Android, Windows Phone) -we can use any of the new development platforms "Titanium, Phone Gap"
- User accessibility preference (Public, Private, Hybrid)
- Kinds of data that will be imported and estimate size (images, texts,...)
- Application usage (educational, cultural,...)

--Customized:
- The same template + additional space for comments and special requirements.

After submitting the request, it will go through an approval process by EMC where we specify a lead time based on the app requirements.

After it gets approved, the submitter can verify the information once again to give the final confirmation and sign the terms and conditions for the mobile app creation.

*Proactive:
EMC employees will submit credential requests where they get username and password to access the platform.

Employees can suggest a heritage provider and/or register themselves as volunteers.
Heritage suggesters will go through a form that goes through an approval process.

Volunteers will get notified with the new projects; projects can be 2 types:
- Proactive - after a proactive request gets approved, this committee of volunteers will reach the heritage providers to propose the project and take ownership of it.
- Reactive - after the app is launched the volunteers to be part of the project (Public and Hybrid) and help uploading the hard copy of the materials.

App:

This platform and app will help in preserving heritage by giving back to the community by allowing EMC employees to contribute.
