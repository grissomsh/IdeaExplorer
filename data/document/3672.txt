Global Research Center to fuel innovation

Personal history. Being an E&CE Engineering student and fresh out of college I was passionate about working in the semiconductor industry. I know I would have worked days together without rest to quench my thirst in  this domain. Electrical wiring and motors interested me from the age of 6. I used to make my own electric driver toys at 8.

I had once (still a fresher) written to Intel about my passion and desire to work for free. Unfortunately I didn't get any response. It could have been a win win situation for both but it simply didn't work out. I believe there are similar minds who would do the same and that we should favour circumstances and give them a chance. Miracles will follow.
The idea is to attract passionate minds from all over the world allowing them to show off their vision. Talented minds who could work on a piece of technology and prototype it for a stipend and this would be win win situation for both parties. 

Itâ€™s about time we build a state of the art Lab and indulge the brightest minds to research and bring out prototypes that could change the future on how data is stored. Invites could be given out to top engineering colleges across the world and allow selected candidates to work on bits and pieces of storage & software technology. These modular innovations could find its way into flagship products like Symmetrix, Viper etc and fit into the big picture. This is a bold step and if done under the right leadership miracles in technology can be a common scene in our very own lab that could change the future of mankind.
