Humans of EMC
 Sharing stories about the ups and downs of our lives with fellow employees to create a network of care competition and empathy among our selves 
Inspired by "Humans of New York" Facebook page
A space in the Inside EMC home page where a photo of an employee and a short paragraph that describe a struggle he faced, a story he want to share, a value he want to promot or just whatever he is thinking of right now
Making every one see that regardless of how different we are we still aspire for the same things and face similar problems and that we all are just people.
Increase the senses of belonging among all employees
