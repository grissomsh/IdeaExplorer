Captiva + InfoArchive integration
Integration of products and create new solution is part of ECD challenge
N/A
According to law - companies must storage data (invoices, claims, forms etc.) for a certain period of time.
Captiva Capture allows to:
Scan/Import -> Structure-> Export data from paper or digital carrier
InfoArchive - a unified enterprise archiving platform that stores related structured data and unstructured content in a single consolidated repository.


So I suggest to integrate Captiva and InfoArchive
To create solution which will allow to customer storage data for a certain period of time.
Customer will have end-to-end solution for import and processing the documents or another data and them storage it using enterprise archiving platform (InfoArchive)
