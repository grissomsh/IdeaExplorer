Taxi Security
The application provided is a typical implementation of IOT as it uses internet and technology for improving services and increasing customers satisfaction, Its also very useful for a smart cities with large number of people holding smartphones and are connected to internet, It's also easily doable as it will be a mobile application for Android and IOS platforms 
I came up with the idea as i always wished to be able to give a review to taxi drivers and wished to find any way to know if the taxi i am stopping is a safe one or not, and as i worked a lot in mobile applications development, i suggested the solution to be a mobile application as most of us have smartphones and such app can be easily used
Develop a mobile application that can be compatible with both Android and IOS platforms For giving a review and a feedback on a taxi driver, The application will work as follows,
- Before starting your trip with the taxi, take a photo of the car plate and wait to get a feedback on this driver, either this taxi is Green (Safe), Orange (Risky), Red (Not Safe)
- The feedback you get will be based on the review that other people have submitted after finishing their trip with this taxi
- The app will automatically send an email or SMS to a list of people you specify with When you started your trip, the taxi plate photo, from where you stopped that taxi
- when you finish your trip, you can give a rank to the driver from 1 to 10 and you can write your feedback about his how good or bad was the trip  

This idea can be extended also that the driver can also take a picture of the customer to know if he is a safe, risky or not safe one, because a lot of crises and thefts of taxi cars happen also from the customer side

- Succession of this idea by implementing this application and use it to have safe trips with Taxi drivers. Such an application needs a big storage system to save data of taxi drivers, the feedback and people comments on them and it definitely need rapid analysis on Big Data to provide a fast feedback about the driver before you start your trip, and also need fast connection to Internet.

-The company will benefit from this idea by giving a solution for the big data to save the submitted feedback, reviews and drivers plates, and analyze it. EMC2 will make money by entering with its storage system to store this huge amount of data and provide analytical solutions on it.

- Definitely this app will improve customer satisfaction on the transportation service
