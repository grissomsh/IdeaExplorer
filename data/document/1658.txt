Using Memristors (Non-Volatile Universal memory) in EMC Servers
By 2020, about 30 billion connected devices will be there, generating Huge amounts of data.  The Current Systems infrastructure needs a Transformational change to collect, process, store, and analyze this kind of data
"In 2008, a team at HP Labs announced that they have found the missing memristor . this technology has been around for decades, at least in theory. The concept of the memristor (a combination of “memory” and “resistor”) was conceived by University of California Berkekey— a theoretical fourth kind of passive electronic component.
Collapsing the Memory Hierarchy by using Non-Volatile Universal memory can efficiently Solve this Puzzle,Why not hold all your data in main memory, all of the time ? with a huge Memory that is Very Fast and that is non volatile, we can simply use the same memory for storing and processing data and at the same time which significantly decrease power consumption by 80%  and eliminate the wasted time of transferring data from Disks to memory and vice verse
if EMC Starts building machines that uses Memristors or "Non-Volatile Universal memory"  it will Change the whole industry by Reducing 90% of energy and decreasing cost by 77% and afford a Much Faster machines that can deal with the 2020 data Challenges which will be an excellent instrument to differentiate EMC from its competitors.
