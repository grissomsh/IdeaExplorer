The EMC new workplace 

We would like to think that our idea will help EMC create a modern and fun workplace.
This idea will allow us to utilize EMC's IT infrastructure and product to address the challenge. 
This ID combines all ideas we previously submitted in this idea in one big idea.
We came up with the idea to utilize EMC's infrastructure to make work more fun and more third platform oriented.
Since then we have been adding features for the ID usage, as well as working on other ideas,  and all of them will be added in ONE big idea to involve them all.


This Idea  is a long term plan that will transform EMC's entire workplace.
It combines Ideas (2015000507, 2015000506, 2015000505, 2015000502) into one big idea.
Basically one mobile phone ID that you can use for everything including logging into meeting rooms that have voice recording capabilities.
Also having VMs instead of 2nd platform devices to fully utilize or resources.
This will have transform the whole EMC great place to work.

This will position EMC higher in the list of a great place to work as well as create a new and fully integrated 3rd platform work environment. EMC could even creat new products and penetrate new markets with these ideas.
