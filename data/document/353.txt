EMC Digital Manufacturing Initiative

I propose an EMC Digital Manufacturing Initiative.

Digital manufacturing is the use of an integrated, computer-based system comprised of simulation, three-dimensional (3D) visualization, analytics and various collaboration tools to create product and manufacturing process definitions simultaneously.

By capturing data at every stage of the production process—and by deploying specially-designed software and other digital tools—EMC Manufacturing can;

Efficiently share and revise their digital designs. 

Connect different parts of the manufacturing life-cycle through data

Utilize that information to make smarter, more efficient business decisions.

Digital technologies have transformed communications, finance and entertainment, they are now in the process of transforming the way parts, components and complete systems are being manufactured.

Let’s take that first step.
