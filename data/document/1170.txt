Cloud Application Reverse Auction
Leverage EMC's Pivotal Cloud Foundry asset in order to attract Cloud Providers to use EMC Services and take over portions of growing cloud PaaS offerings.
We came up with this idea while comparing the cloud provider offerings trying to understand the difference between the offerings (price, value)
The implementation requires a well defined capability format for application owner (customer) to describe the application requirements.

The components supported in the format must cover all cloud application requirements and be extensible for the always growing data services market.

For each resource, the customer will describe the SLA's & latency requirements. Cloud providers or a broker managing those suites can bid.

The deployment, once a bid is accepted, can be automated to configure the services and push the application to start serving in the winning cloud.

Application resources to be described:

Database - relational standard SQL database (e.g. MySQL/Postgres instances)
Object Store - key value pair service (E.g. Amazon S3)
Messaging (E.g. RabbitMQ)
Memcache (E.g. Reddis)
NoSQL
Mail service
Each resource will describe SLA for performance and Copy management including RTO RPO. each resource type with it's specific relevant metrics that will be defined in the protocol.

EMC will certify the cloud providers for the reported SLA levels, and their support of EMC enterprise grade data protection products where possible.
EMC could charge cloud providers for joining the site, or take percentage out of every successful deal.
Pivotal Cloud Foundry will become the de-facto industry standard for PaaS.
