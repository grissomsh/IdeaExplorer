Backup File system with zero Impact to Network and NAS server
Provides ability to take a backup with NAS (eNAS/VNX) with zero impact on Network Impact and Host server. 
Protectpoint was first integrated solution between VMAX and Datadomain organizations. As eNAS embedded on VMAX3 using HYPEROS, so explored integration with protectpoints. 
Solution is to integrate NAS with Protectpoint product. 
1.	The File system created on the blocks (SymmDevice) shall be shared with Protect Point for backup, full restore and Granular restore.
2.	ProtectPoint Agent can run on Control Station of eNAS to trigger protectpoint commands. 
3.	Applications or File system consistency is delivered by freezing the IO on the File System and triggering the backups.
 
- Proving backup solution for FILE, full back up at the cost of incremental. 
- Very less Application freezes time for back up.
- Integrated solution using multiple EMC products
