HOP  POOL N CONNECT
Most of the employees make use of flexible timing, it is difficult to strict to one pool and one time.
Need to adjust daily routine according to others timing.
Not easy to track the people enrolled for the pooling.
No flexibility to share the ride with people, who are not enrolled.
Eg : If I’m driving, I don’t want to feel like a driver who has to wait for someone else to leave home or finish  work. I want to leave when I’m ready, not when my fellow car-pooler is. Whoever drives on the day is the dominant player. If he’s finished work on time and someone who’s travelling with him is late, the other guy has to find a way  
back. If he’s late and the other guy’s finished early, the car leaves when he’s done. Even if I know people I  travel with, it starts feeling like a drag in a little while, so we decide to part ways.
I was talking about traffic in bangalore also how often we meet though travel in same route. So idea came how we can have our own app, which will help to build network, know each other better, encourage for pooling, there by contributing to environment protection.
Idea is from existing car pooling which didnot pickup and online cab service.
Interested Riders can track the leaders, and plan the pool and time, pickup point etc.

Add a value to Great Place to Work.
If rolled out, probably recognized as the first company in India to have this facility.
Opportunity to meet people from different BU, know, their role, skills and areas of working. 
Opportunity to expand employee network and will help in collaboration with other BU
Commute makes fun.
Encourages employees to keep their vehicle off road, thereby reducing the traffic and pollution.
Relieved from daily stress of traffic and driving.
Probability of getting the drop/pickup is a high, compared to fix pooling.
No dependency on one fixed pool.
It is beneficial, who have limited access to public and private transportation
It is WIN-WIN situation for all.
