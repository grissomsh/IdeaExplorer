Team DU/DL United

Worked on a number of DU/DL cases recently where it is difficult to undertsand what was occurring at the customer site at the point of the outage. 
When a DU/DL outage is experienced the Site Engineer records a completed picture of the customer site e.g. system type, config, work load, environment, syetem position, fire alarm activation, wireless hub or telephone repeater overhead etc. and updates the DU/DL case template. 
All this information along with the system error codes and log files are loaded to an eRoom. Then the Site Engineer or CSM sets up a call with the SBMT or GDE Engineering team to hand over all the details and answer any of the additional questions that may arise. A sense of the customer temperature would also be communicated. Point contact names would be put forward should additional questions arise.
All information would then be shared with the commodity supplier to speed up the root cause effort.
