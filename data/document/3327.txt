Bring Your Pets To Work Day 

Ideation session


For one day of the year, employees are allowed to bring their favorite pet (cat, dog, fish, turtle etc.) to the office. Not only will the owner have a great time with his pet, but the other employees can also have fun playing with other's pets. Its a way of teambuilding and bringing employees together.
