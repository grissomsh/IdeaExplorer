Support for FsaaS (File System as a service) in Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF)
This idea is related to enhancing the PCF platform to support file system dependent workloads.
While we were working with PCF for the project, we discovered that this idea would bridge the 2nd platform and 3rd platform transition.
Develop a persistent file system service and service broker to solve this problem. With this service, applications can scale to dozens or even hundreds of instances while sharing persistent file storage.

Any applications that are in need of persistent file system can dynamically bind this service. File service can use any of the back end storage including EMC products.

A persistent file system service allows apps to do the following:
Share files across multiple instances of an app
Store files that persist if an app is removed (providing the service is not deleted) or if the server is restarted.
Conserve space on file systems allocated within the VM instance by referencing the persistent file system instead.

This new FsaaS service will enable new/existing customers who has file system dependent workload to move to 3rd platform PaaS PCF.  
Existing customers who are already using EMC products can also migrate to 3rd platform with out changing the architecture.
New customers will be attracted to buy EMC converged infrastructure storage systems as the support is available via this service.

Use cases/industries: 
Content management system (CMS) such as wordpress, Documentum etc
Video hosting services
