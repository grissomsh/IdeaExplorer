Parking Lights for Empty Slots in the Garage

I have seen this applicable at parking lots in malls. I figured this is a much easier solution as you can quickly identify the empty slots as you scan quickly through the garage without having to move around with your car looking for one. 
This idea would help employees find empty slots in the parking lot or garage without having to move around with the car. The long minutes we spend trying to look for an empty parking place to park can be used more efficiently, especially when we are in a hurry for meetings, courses, etc. If the garage is completely full, a billboard outside the garage which initially shows how many empty slots there are would display when the garage is full so we won't have to enter the garage in the first place.
