Track Me

We saw this idea implemented at another company and we thought why not EMC?

It will be a competition between different teams within the COE or it could be globally.  Each competitor will be provided with a pedometer to track the number of steps they took all day, at the end of each week the participant will submit the number of steps they walked. The pedometer would be a small device that could be attached to the belt or to a watch that should be worn all the time.

The competition could be done quarterly.

This would help encourage employees to : 
. park at a further distance away from their destination
. take the stairs instead of the elevator
. choose the first option to walk to any destination instead of taking the car

Having it done as a competition, it will encourage employees to be more keen on walking, and it eventually could become a habit. Also it will reduce carbon foot print since employees will use their cars less.
