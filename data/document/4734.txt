COE internal Library & Book Club

Brainstorming session
We will build an internal library for EMC employees just couple of shelves where employees will share their books with each other so that all people can have access to books.
and we will create a book club where all members agree to read a specific book and held a gathering to discuss this book.
This idea will encourage people to read and communicate and engage in EMC activities.
