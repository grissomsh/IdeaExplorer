Individual Office Sound Control
Having control over a) whether to listen to music/radio or not during work and b) which music / radio station to listen to gives employees a sense of control over there environment, and would provide employees a cutting edge, modern & fun work environment. 
During our idea generation session, background noise in the office was discussed. It became apparent that they is huge variety in people's preferences of music and noise levels, during their working day, particularly in open plan offices. The ability to hear music/sounds that other people cannot hear, was agreed to be a cutting edge and contemporary idea.
Allowing Employees to access spotify, radio channels or even music on their PC's/Laptops/devices would be required. The options available could be the use of headphones or desk speakers. However, in order not to discourage collaboration between employees (headphones) or to not to impact other employees (noise levels), our suggestion is for EMC to pilot cutting edge technology, like "hypersound" (search "beams of sound, news-scientist).
Evidence proves that listening to music to relaxes people & can improve performance. However, for focuses tasks, quietness is required. A great place to work offers flexibility. The flexibility to choose noise levels and the soundtrack for your day could be another option.
