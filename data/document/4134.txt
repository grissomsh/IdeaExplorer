Multi-utility USB Disk drive for VPLEX/VE product

while working with VPLEX/VE system found that we can use USB disk drive for multiple usecase. One of them is currently RAM reservation on vDirectors. It can also be used for many others requirement
This proposed solution helps above problems using USB disk drive:

1. USB disk drive attached to ESX host can be used as RAM booster for vDirectors. This will avoid RAM resource crunches on VPLEX/VE system.

2. USB disk drive can be used as log collection space for C-D tool. If user starts C-D and there is no space left on /diag/collect-diagnostic directory then instead of failing C-D run it will dump the logs at this USB provided storage space.

3. USB storage space can be used as non-volatile for nvol in-memory copy image of metavol. This will help in case of metavol inaccessibility and director reboot scenario.

4. USB Disk drive can have “Powered By VPLEX/VE” logo that can have good visibility and good marketing strategy.
