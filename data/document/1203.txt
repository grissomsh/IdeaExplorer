Great place to work with Home Office Location or Longer Work from Home options for ICOE Employees
The facility of Home Office Location is common in Certain EMC Offices, However we do not have a defined Regular long work from homes or opting for Home office atleast for non Customer facing roles. The company may set some standards for Home office and Long Work form home options Eligibility criteria. Anybody who is considered eligible should have the facility to leverage it.

Several leading MNC's in the country do have options for Home office or longer Work from Homes with a similar kind of roles (non customer facing). As of now Multiple Work from Home is Possible in few Business units, However it is yet to be a standard across GS or India COE. Being close to seven years old in the company I do see a hope of implementing such kind of facilities in the near future.
There no standard rule in India COE for Home Office Location or Longer Work from Home options. Yes! we do have a Robust Matrices and EMC could set a standard for Home office and Long Work form home option Eligibility criteria for EMC employee.

In a scenario, If just 10% of the employees get the option for Home Office or longer Work from home we may Consider the Factors:

-Reducing Company's Transport Cost
-Reducing Company's Security Cost
-Reducing Company's AC & lighting cost
-Reducing Workstation & Seat Rent Cost

There is a saying A healthy Mind is the Healthy Body, With the current competitive environment in the workplace we yearn for a break.
