Voting button during chat

It came to me while I was reading the list of challenges. As soon as I read the description for the IT challenge I got this idea. Also, I once heard my supervisor Afifi talking about something like this but for mobile.
The new Unified Communication app will combine email features with chat features. Email has an option to vote, and my idea is to add real-time voting option to chat as well. For example, if someone initiates a group chat to talk and agree on a certain time and place for the next meeting, all the members of the chat could vote on the different options and thus the meeting time can be set.
