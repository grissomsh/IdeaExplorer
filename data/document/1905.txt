Viper product enhancement
1. Netgroup update
New group creation is not available in ViPR. The current re-export of NFS file shares are causing I/O issues: runtime activities that are actively using the file share could be interrupted. For example, database transactions could be terminated.
2. VDM (Virtual Data Mover â€“ may be already in product backlog)
	ViPR does not have a Create VDM feature. VDMS are being created manually from VNX.
	Only one VDM in the complete VNX array can be ingested in ViPR. As a result, managing VDMS in a VNX array are primarily done manually. ViPR should either ingest all the VDMS or provide a feature to specify which VDMS should be ingested. 
day to day work
ADD netgroup feature in viper
it will make NFS file share automation end to end.
