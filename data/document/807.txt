Solar System
Problem is that the electricity does cut off a lot in Egypt. 
The solution for that is EMC using Generators. 
The problem of the generators is that they cost a lot of money and need maintenance.

If EMC uses Solar System it will help the environment at most. 
Also it will reduce the cost of electricity that EMC has to pay each year. 

It would benefit the company by reducing the costs that are payed every year in electricity.
