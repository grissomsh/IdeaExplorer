Employee Satisfaction
Feeling appreciated
N/A
We have 4 segments that are all equally important. The scoring would be based on the Best performance in each Segment. The scores are extracted from BT reports (or EAS or any other tool according to department).
 A) Calls Handled             
 B) Calls per Hour
 C) Average Talk Time        
 D) Average Wrap-up Time

By the end of each month we would be able to highlight the top 3 that would receive rewards &/or cause of applause on a monthly basis. The communication Committee cheers them on the Global CST VIC Space
The objective is to:
   1. Ensure recognition consistency
   2. Create a competitive environment
   3. Enhance our AHT & AWUT.
   4. Motivate CSTs
Competitive environments enhances productivity
