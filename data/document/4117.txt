Loan through the company

Emails about bank representivies in premises gave me the idea why dont we keep it internal within EMC.
Why can’t we get personal loans through the company with less interest for the company’s employee? The monthly payment for this loan could be subtracted directly from the monthly salary. This way EMC gets thier monthly payment with interest benefiting and benefiting the employees with better interest rates and easier ways to make the payments.
