Create analytic driven knowledge base system for HW diagnostic testware in MFG
Improve efficiency for technician operation  when handling issue reported from testware in MFG
Lots of issues are not new issues however technician still need time to handle so we are wondering how can we do this better
Create an analytic driven knowledge base system for HW diagnostic testware in MFG and connect to testware . If there is an issue which happen , it can automatically search it in our analytic driven knowledge base system ,if find it ,then automatically close this issue,if there is a new issue ,cant' find it in current system ,then search this in other knowledge base system like in GHTS/GAME ,if still can't , we can  add a new knowledge base in this system
If we implement this , it will significantly reduce error deposition for technician and achieve time to test
