Client-side hints to the storage
Improvements to SCSI protocols to improve our products.
Read the DIX spec.
SCSI has an extension for data integrity called DIF/DIX (see https://oss.oracle.com/~mkp/docs/dix.pdf for some details). Specifically, it contains 16bits for application tag, which AFAIK, aren't used in the client -> server direction.

The idea is that the client can send hints to the storage about the data. The storage may or may not make use of those hints when processing the data.

Examples:

- Do not compress - if the content is already pre-compressed (MP3's, jpegs, etc.) or encrypted - do not bother.

- QoS - hint (similar to network's DSCP) about the QoS wished for this block of data.

- Replication priority - perhaps within the same volume some blocks should get higher priority for replication ('QoS for replication' ?)

- Do not cache - some information isn't going to be used by the client in the near term future, so don't bother caching (example: when a VM is shutting down, it's writing quite a lot of logs and stuff).

- This could be developed in Linux in an open source fashion - showing how EMC contributes to OSS.
- Some of it can clearly improve our performance substantially.
- I don't think it's too hard to implement.
