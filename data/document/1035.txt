Browser based Navigation instead of  Java for Avamar Admin GUI
Avamar Java Admin GUI is very slow, hangs ,always issues about the JRE versions.
While working with customers found Java security issues, Admin Console issues that triggered this idea.I am only one involved
As every Application is moving towards Browser based functionality , We should avoid Java and start at browser based functionality .

No need to update JRE, Will stop Java hang issues. Easy navigation via browser
