Corporate Exchange Program
NA
This new idea came up to me days ago when I was thinking about the trainings offered by EMC and I thought that exchange programs are usually seen in universities and schools but I believe it would be extremely effective in organizations as well. 
EMC would implement an employee exchange program within each department. For example, implementing an exchange program between the licensing departments located across the world. This would be rounds and in each round, an employee gets to travel to another location, learn and expand his knowledge within his department for a specific duration. For example, an employee located in Egypt can exchange with another in Hopkinton. 

Job duties can be performed during the visit in coordination with the team he is visiting to expand the learning curve. Connecting the teams around the world will further result in unified, global processes and the achievement of efficiency and effectiveness. 
He will then return and this will result in an evolved employee with a very rich experience and a strong knowledge base. This employee will be able to learn how his team mates located elsewhere preform their job duties and attend to challenges. This will also strengthen team spirit and synergy within functions even if teams are located worldwide.
