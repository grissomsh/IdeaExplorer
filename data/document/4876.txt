Customer Feedback

I've seen many companies exploit twitter to their advantage and exploiting the fact that the number of twitter users is basically infinite and the volume of traffic/activity on twitter is extremely high.
As well know EMC has its own Twitter account, why not introduce some sort of competition where we can for example assign a hashtag called #EMCFeedback which customers can use to submit brief feedback via twitter. The customers with most posts can perhaps gain some sort of prize such enjoying special offers or relative discounts and what not from EMC. Twitter is an already established social media tool and I cannot imagine any of our customers isn't a member there. So the stage is all set to launch this. We don't need to spend money on setting up a communications infrastructure not do we need to market to this infrastrcutre, its all ready and enjoying the best publicity anyone can even dream of.
