Supplier/Contract Manufacturer Green Revolving Loan Fund 

A twist on Kathrin Winkler, Michael Norbeck, and many others’ idea of an internal Green Revolving Loan Fund. This version of the idea was born in a conversation with Michael Norbeck on potential ways to increase engagement on energy efficiency opportunities with EMC’s contract manufacturers.  
EMC creates a Green Revolving Loan Fund to be used for energy efficiency projects with strong ROIs. Loans repayments are re-entered back into the Fund for use in future loans.   
While EMC has exhausted the low hanging fruit opportunities for energy efficiency in our facilities, our suppliers and contract manufactures likely have these kinds of opportunities available. In addition to having loans repayments, EMC may be able to leverage additional savings off of lowered cost of manufacturing.
