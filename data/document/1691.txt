Fun Broadcast
Creating a more suitable environment for employees to be innovative and creative and to spread fun inside all the COEs arround the globe using existing instruments with near zero cost and make the employees more involved together socially as a result of that they will know each other well so communication among all EMC employees. Their social interaction and comptability will increase as well as their productivity as teams and the results will appear also in collaborations.
After work we made a small tournament between three teams and it was finished so quickly.We had fun but we did not actually feel it was a tournament.so we (the competing teams) asked ourselves ,what if we had a tournament  across all the EMC CEOs around the globe.That would be an interesting idea and will help all the employees to socially involve with each-other and that will be reflected during turn overs and during collaborations between different CEOs around the globe. 
This idea shows the employees funny side through broadcasting the tournments held in the flex room to all the CEOs around the globe.This allows fun competitions showing the good spirit among employees and that will help working between teams .
As we all know that there are flex rooms in all the COE's and different EMC branches and they have XBOX and Playstation included in them, we could use this to make the employees have more fun, the idea is to let them not only play with each other locally but we could make a tournament across the different COE's and we could make a tournament between the employees online and there will be champions and we could give them awards
If this idea is implemented well it would enhance the internal relationship among EMC employees and make communication much better among them which can make the productivity much more better and leverage the level of Customers satisfaction ,cause this idea makes it much easy to any EMC employee to ask for help from any of EMC employee around the globe.
