L2 tasks seperate section in Service Request
Enhancing the process of service requests being handled to make it easier for TSEs
Being confused when taking ownership of previous SR where tasks are mixed and narrowed in small space with field tasks
-Having separate side-section in each service request showing if there are L2 task being created.

-Section will show the following:
1. L2 task description
2. L2 task owner and queue
3. NCC of the L2 task


-Saving employees time as this will result in faster resolution to customers
-Making it easy and quick to view L2 tasks
