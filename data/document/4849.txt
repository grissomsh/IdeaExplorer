SYMCLI META command limitations

while creating Meta LUN's if they are not in sequence , lot of time is spent to form meta and run symconfigure scripts. I faced lot of problems while executing CRQ's. Hence addressing this will help people to avoid overhead / mistakes.
No SYMCLI for meta LUN creation if LUN's are not in sequence. We can provide size and device list in a file, then symconfigure should be able to form meta with the no. of devices in that file
