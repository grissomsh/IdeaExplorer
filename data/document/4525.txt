Power Saving - FAN REGULATION

Found in 'DATA CENTER'. The system was running with FAN, even though the temperature in DATA CENTER was kept too cool condition. 
Use SENSOR technology to predict the temperature in engine [ FA,DA,KVM ]and power on/off automatically or we can ‘REGULATE’ rpm of FAN based on required temperature. 
Ex: System require minimum temperature between 70F. 
If temperature falls below 70F, then switch OFF FAN.
If temperature above 70F to 80F, then regulate FAN rpm.
If temperature increase, then increase the FAN RPM. soon.
