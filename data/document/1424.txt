Green VNX/VNXe Storage Enclosure
This idea can increase the energy efficiency of our storage products and reduce the thermal pollution accordingly, and this helps the EMC to provide more "Green" products to our customer.
We have a local lab in Shanghai for the VNX/VNXe projects developing, and I found the lab became very hot after we set up 10 more Bearcat systems in it. So I'm think if we can use this power, I know the semiconductor thermoelectric generator is used widely in many areas; thus I consider we can use this technology to  increase the energy efficiency of our storage products and reduce the thermal pollution.
The solution is to add the semiconductor thermoelectric generators into the VNX/VNXe storage enclosure and we may develop a small control module to collect the generated electric energy and use this power to charge the battery modules  or drive some monitor sensors in the enclosure.

The position of the semiconductor thermoelectric generator can be between the CPU module and the CPU heatsink.

In following example, we use the semiconductor thermoelectric generator "SP1848" to integrate into the existing VNXe Bearcat DPE.

Reference Spec of the SP1814:in
http://www.alldatasheet.com/view.jsp?Searchword=Sp1848

SP1814 can generate the electric energy in following conditions:
Temperature difference of 20 degrees: open circuit voltage 0.97V, power current: 225MA
Temperature difference of 40 degrees: open circuit voltage 1.8V, power current: 368MA
Temperature difference of 60 degrees: open circuit voltage 2.4V, power current: 469MA

The VNXe Bearcat DPE has 2 Storgae Processors (SP) and supports 25 SAS disk drives.

1. Since the SP CPU module is the major heat source in the DPE, so we assume it can provide 40 degree temperature difference and we can integrate 3 SP1848 in series connection to the CPU heatsink. Thus the power of this sub-system can be:

1.8V x 368mA x 3 = 1.9872W

2. For the SAS disks, if we assume it can provide 20 degrees temperature difference; and we can attach one SP1848 for one disk, then the power of this sub-system can be:

0.97V x 225mA x 20(*) = 4.365W connection

(*) Assume the SAS disk number will be reduced to 20 as multiple SP1848 will take up extra space in the DPE.

3. So the total power of the new VNXe Bearcat DPE will be about 8W. 

1.9872W x 2(*) + 4.365W = 8.3394W ~=8W


So one new VNXe Bearcat DPE can generate 70080Wh electric energy every year, and it can reduce the thermal pollution in 252288000J.
As we've calculated in the above example, one VNXe Bearcat DPE can generate 70080Wh every year. As the Bearcat DPE is a low-end product, and our customer can use multiple Bearcat DPE to build a large storage cloud. So we can image if such storage cloud has 100 VNXe Bearcat DPEs, then it can generate 7008000Wh=7008kWh every year and this means this storage cloud can reduce the thermal pollution in 25228800000J.
