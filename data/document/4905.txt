Essential medicines

This was the case which has been happened to me i was feeling from heavy head ache but i cant able to reach for any medicine when i reached the doctor he/she was not available and it made me to stop all my work and i have to opt for a sick leave for silly head ache .

If those medicine were available on my floor security i would have not got into that much trouble and no need of sick leave too.

By this we can have a uninterrupted client service and improve EMC infrastructure


Basic Essential medicines should be available on all the Floor reception so that that when ever we have a trouble we no need to contact doctor on the floor since he /she may be available or not.

It make employee relief from his pain and he can start working back as soon as possible.
