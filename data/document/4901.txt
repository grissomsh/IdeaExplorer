vCAFEs - vFabric Cloud Application Platform with Authorization, Federation and Enterprise Social Security

I had worked on a POC for an AxM AuthAgent for Tomcat. I drew inspiration from that POC which shares a similar architecture and feature set. 
tc-server AuthAgent is the core component of the vCAFEs identity framework.
tc-server AuthAgent has a plug-n-play design, where-in required security aspects can be configured.
At the core, the AuthAgent uses Valves to intercept requests for processing and custom JAAS modules to associate the Subject to the appropriate access control context.
AuthAgent also leverages the Spring framework, to provide support for Social Logins, REST and runtime performance monitoring.
It has out-of-the-box integration with enterprise grade products like, 
	-RSA AccessManager, 
	-RSA Federated Identity Provider, 
	-RSA Aveska, 
	-RSA Authentication Manager, 
	-RSA Adaptive Authentication, 
	-RSA Passban
	-RSA Adaptive Directory and
	-RSA Envision 

Basic Workflow:
---------------
-Configure an appropriate valve in the context.xml of the web application
	- For ex-  
		-Configure XACML valve for fine grained AuthZ
		-Configure OpenID | OAuth valve for social logins
-AuthAgent intercepts requests for processing.
-If resource is protected, a login page is provided based on the configured AuthN method.
-Post login, the user is redirected to the resource.
