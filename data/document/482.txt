This idea will help troubleshoot basic issues based on the error messages - CTD products supportability 
In case of failure at times a solution is readily available but we end spending lot of time to hit the right solution. This will help in faster search of solutions
We should have an mobile app which will contain a database of all error messages in a product along wit its best solution. Any end user runs into an issue can take a snapshot of the issue and run a search through the app. The app should be capable of
1) Allow upload text/picture of the error message reported by the product in the log

2) App should be able to perform a text/picture search 

3) Provide the best solution to fix the issue in order of relevance 

There are already existing issues in defect tracking system & also we can find some solution online. We just need to collate this in one location
Save time  - save support calls - Solution readily available at fingertip in an app
