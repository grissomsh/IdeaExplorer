Webex Chat Time Stamp

This is a daily challenge faced when communicating with the customer and trying to set a certain level of expectation for example when providing the customer with periodic updates or certain business critical operations such as reboots or scheduled downtime activities.
Can be simply embedded in the webex toolbar source code; retrieving the time from the machine controlling the webex and printing the time stamp below every chat message sent.
