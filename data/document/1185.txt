Transport system 
I think this relates to the challenge as it looks at elements of workplace of the future. As there is so much discussion about carbon emissions, maybe cars wont be used in the future and only buses can be used for everybody. 
I came up with this idea as I travel to and from work everyday by car and also I travel to local manufactures site where each employee needs to drive to the site. 
I would like to have a new system of transport between EMC sites and EMC partners. Example in Cork, there are three plants with no direct transport link between the sites. Additionally, EMC does business with KNN and Flex Cork with also no direct route to these sites.
I think it would help employees a great deal as they wouldn't need to bring their own cars to work. Additionally, it would save no emissions and cut down EMC carbon footprint.
