Shipments' Tracking Devices
This idea is deeply embedded in the core of the Global Product Operations Challenge, as it will track the product through the supply chain process and help solve the problems found in it.
This idea came to me when I was waiting for a shipment. I thought what if I could track the shipment on the map to know exactly where it is. From this perspective the idea evolved into a more practical business approach.
Keeping tracking devices in every shipment, this will show the real time spent in each stage of the supply chain. These times can be compared to the forescasted times, knowing the more realistic times. This will also show where the bottlenecks exist and what problems are causing them, as it will show which stages have the longest times. It will also give accurate estimates as when the products will be delivered to keep the good reputation with the customer.
This will be a small part attached to every shipment. This will affect the business in various ways, it will improve customer satisfaction through giving the customer clear and accurate shipping dates. It will optimize the supply chain process by showing the flaws within it and eliminating them eventually.
