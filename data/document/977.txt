Green office 
A green office is a place where the mechanical, lighting, electrical and computer systems are designed for maximum energy efficiency and minimum environmental impact which is in line with EMC project of Go Green.
I came to know about this idea when I came to know about the invention of photovoltiac trasparent glass.
My idea if implemented, will save energy if we start using natural light instead of the mechanical light to its optimum level. With advent of photo voltaic transparent glass, once implemented our office premise, will generate immense energy which will solve the enery issue and save lots of electricity costs.
It would be a big success and company will save a lots of cost in terms of money.
