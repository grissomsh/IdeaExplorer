SAP HANA database load simulation tool
Improves internal development processes for various solutions (storage, DR, backup) around SAP HANA
The idea came up when we started witha  small tool to generate random data to create a larger HANA database for the HANA certification projects.
Create a tool which generates random HANA data (multi-billion records), simulates various HANA workloads (OLAP and OLTP), and utilize the HANA in-memory database as well as the disk based Dynamic Tiering component based on SAP IQ (aka Sybase IQ)
Such a tool would improve productivity of the teams working on SAP HANA and significantly reduce time and effort to create HANA lab environments.
