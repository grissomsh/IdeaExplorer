Improving turnaround times for customer reported defects
This idea aligns with the TCE Challenge to improve customer experience. The current bug tracking system provides little or no support to reporters/customer support
to offer any solution to the defects. The only interface provided by bug trackers is a free text search which is not effective in finding actionable suggestions.
The idea came up as part of a research to address the challenge of large number of defects that needed no code changes for resolution in RSA Security Analytics product suite. About 70% of the defects filed are being resolved by making configuration changes. These cases could have been potentially resolved by customer support without involving development which
causes delays.
The data sources containing information about a feature or product consists of - documentation, internal wiki, code comments, bug tracking system, previously fixed issues, knowledge base articles, emails. The proposed expert system will consist of separate document corpus for each major feature of the product suite. All the documents, suitably tagged, will be parsed to get the content, extract the relevant raw text, and indexed into the respective corpus. Model building will utilize open source Python NLTK tool. Once the corpus has been set up, customer support can call up documents with queries. Relevance, precision and recall will be used to determine the quality of search results. Other metrics of relevance - authoritativeness of data source, recency of document, how often the document is retrieved by other users, etc. will be used to refine the model over time. 
This will help improve customer satisfaction as it will improve the turn around time for defect resolution. It will provide suggestions/ideas for customer support to try 
things out and resolve the issue as soon as it is reported by customer without having to involve development that could incur delays.
