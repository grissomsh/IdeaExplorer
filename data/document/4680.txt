EMC-Pulse

Despite of MyVoice survey every year, there are still un-addressed areas. EMC Pulse can provide deeper insights to identify exact areas and  reasons which need improvement.
The current software can address following human resource areas by analyzing data inputs from past years:
1>	Decline trend in specific Areas
2>	Improvement Trend in specific Areas 
3>	Sudden Spike Areas
4>	Groups/Teams which are happy and unhappy.
5>	Identify concern, suggestions, and future trends from each group/team that EMC should address.
6>	Reasons for each of the above criteria [Attrition, Work Life balance, Recognition, Compensation].
The above data has to be available at organization and group level.
EMC ASD group has software called Watch4net, it will collect different type of raw data and then analyze the data and generate comprehensive reports and identifies alarming trends [alerts] based on conditions. Its capability to analyze the historical data (data collected for weeks/months/years), is very useful for MyVoice data which is collected for years.
