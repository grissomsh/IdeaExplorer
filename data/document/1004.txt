Restoration of client files in Networker Environment in absence of backup server.
This will enhance EMC backup and recovery tool namely EMC Networker.
As my primary skill has been TSM so when I started working on EMC Network I faced this difficulty and came to this idea.
Once server is moved to a new dc where we do not have a Networker environment under which the client was being backed up in that case if the data is there on the tape which is >LO5 then we can perform restoration by directly attaching the tape library to the client and perform restore.
This will be an added feature with EMC Networker once incorporated. This can be a salable point to the customer.
