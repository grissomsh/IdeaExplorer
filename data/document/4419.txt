Source Aggregated Test Platform

The idea is from the previous QA forum and utest before a couple of years. 
The tool should have two parts, backend is one data engine to aggregate and transmit the data from the different source(test 
tools, databases and so on),frontend is  one friendly page/application to demonstrate test healthy status  called QA Dashboard using chart, report, and the tool should be able to analyze/evaluate  testing  quality cross the different products/projects. Even if the different projects has the different measure , But, this approach still has the valuable for monitoring the projects.
