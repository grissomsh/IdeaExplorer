Reducing rework in closing the Debit/Credit Transactions
End to End Business Process Challenge

Cash/Credit application can be done in a simpler & effective way by adding few extra steps to the current process  
This is based on EMC Cash Application process compared to other similar industries under O2C.
We can improve the current process by assigning the approval matrix (based on $$ value) to close the debit/credit transaction at once.

1) Allow & provide pre-approval to cash applicators to close the transactions in full by adjusting the debit/credit transactions upto $25.00 

2) Setup approval matrix to close the partial payments for transactions >$25.00


1) Reducing rework to close the transactions at once
2) Reduction in small $$ Transactions 
3) Reduction in aged buckets
