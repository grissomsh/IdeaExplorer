Build a cloud-based central lab resources management platform to simplify and automate lab resources management

This idea of thought was evolved during brainstorm with Guo, Xiaoyan and Cao, Yu of CTO team as their team. To meet some resource problems and speed up OS/network environment deployment, building a cloud platform using one of the multi-tenant cloud platforms like OpenStack/vCD is necessary.

The idea uses multi-tenancy cloud platform like OpenStack/vCD as clouded based infrastructure. It will integrate all kinds of lab hardware into one cloud platform. 

OpenStack is a collection of open source software projects that can be collectively utilized to operate a cloud network infrastructure in order to provide IaaS. The utilization of OpenStack in this idea is elaborated as follows: 

•	Use OpenStack Orchestration service(or similar service ) provides a template-based orchestration for describing a cloud application by running OpenStack API calls to generate running cloud applications. Integrates some components of OpenStack into a one-file template system. The templates enable user to create most OpenStack resource types, such as server, floating IPs, volumes, security groups, users, and so on. 
•	Use RESTful API exposed by OpenStack to write scripts to automate common tasks in SW lab for user conference. If necessary, develop hardware simulators integrated with server/ template-based orchestration.
•	Use Open vSwitch integrated with cloud platform to simulate complex network environment, like VLAN, load balance, etc..
•	Provide standard OS template or customized template in cloud platform provide by BU users to speed up infrastructure deployment in developing/testing environment.
