Soultion: DOGFOODING
Dogfooding(“eating your own dog food”) is a slang term used to reference a scenario where companies use their own products to improve quality and build confidence. The idea is that if the company expects customers to buy its products, it should also be willing to use those products. By using our own products, we are forced to first hand what the user experience is like and raise hands whenever there are issues or concerns. Here the employee will not be testing the product but will act as an end user, that means he will use it only when it is required for his job. So, ideally there is “NO” investment required. However, the challenge is to implement this and make it part of daily work life.

Internal marketing, potential quality improvement, recommendation of products, process optimization and zero investment.
