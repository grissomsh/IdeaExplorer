"EMC - Up to date" Tool
This is an improvement of the intall base update process
These are combined thoughts aiming to improve the install base data integrity and efficiency.
The idea is to have a tool to be downloaded by customers and Install Base Group.

The tool will allow both parties to update the arrays information (software version, disks version,...etc) on periodic basis (i.e 3 months)

Tools view:
- A place where we can paste the array serial number and it reflects editable information on the array.
- The customers should update the tool with the new change to reflect in EMC install base.
- IBG should have the same tool for monitoring purposes and to be the tool used for systems updates based on the requests they get.
- This tool should be linked to EMC install base to update the information.
- The customer will be held responsible for the updates.
- There will be a reminder on periodic basis to customer to update/acknowledge the server information.
This tool will help in increasing EMC install base efficiency and accuracy of information.
