Saving electricity and power by using Solar Panels 
using solar power contributes in beeinga green environment and buiding a smart city
making use of the solar power since it is a natural resource in Egypt with its great weather. this idea came up to me when i first saw my house's electricity bill and thought of converting to solar power option to save up.
installing Solar panels in EMC Egypt to provide the company with its daily supply of power. we can use regular power in case the panles were out of power. the use of regular power will be the second option.
all power sources are provisioned by the solar panels installed at the top of EMC building. this project has a high return on inverstment and saves money since i spoke to one of the solar panels providers in Egypt and explained to me how it works. In addition it contributes to be a green environment
