Hyper-converged Product powered by Openstack and ScaleIO
Converged infrastructure product is popular now, e.g. Nutanix. And OpenStack is an IaaS, and a popular open srouce project, which is leveraged by many big IT enterprise, e.g. IBM, HP. We propose a new converged product leverage EMC ScaleIO and OpenStack, to grab the share of converged product market, and increase the value to ScaleIO.
We learned something about converged infrastructure product, e.g. Nutanix, which is popular in the IT market. And we know OpenStack is a popular open source IaaS project, and ScaleIO is a powerful converged storage product. So we think about how could leverage them to provide a converged product to  meet the users and marketing requirements.
We propose a hyper-converged product powered by Openstack and ScaleIO. The product should be a cluster with multiple nodes. OpenStack, which is a distributed IaaS software, is install and pre-configured on the cluster to provide compute and network resource to users, through its nova and neutron project. The powerful ScaleIO product is also installed and pre-configured on the cluster to aggregate all disks on the cluster to a big storage pool, and connect with OpenStack through OpenStack cinder project, to provide storage resource. It's a good combination of ScaleIO's converged infrastructure and OpenStack's distributed infrastructure. An unified dashboard is provided by this product to allow system administrators to provision compute, network, storage resources to each tenant, and each tenant user can consume the resource easily through the dashboard.
Converged infrastructure product is popular now, and with great market prospect. As a leading IT infrastructure, EMC should publish a product to grab market share. OpenStack is an open source IaaS project and supported and leveraged by HP, IBM, etc big IT enterprise. We think the converged product powered by OpenStack and ScaleIO, the powerful EMC storage product will be with widely accept by market and users.
