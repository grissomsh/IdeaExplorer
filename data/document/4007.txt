Elite Customer Portal

-
Elite Customer Portal :-

We always talks about being pro-active rather than re-active. Here is a Way to implement the same. The idea is :-

1. Create a seperate portal for elite customers, to get feedbacks from them. A feedback can be ranging from Customer services, products they are using. Any constant problem cutomer is facing with their environment.
2. Customer can also Submit what are their needs, be it specific to any products or a new product. Or may be a enhancement they need in their products.
3. This portal will have option for SR creation as well.

Based on the customer feedbacks, EMC can act in the direction of addressing customer queries and inturn imporve the TCE.
