Booking Meeting Rooms Smartly
If you have a large number of meeting rooms, you face two challenges: Using them efficiently and actually benefitting from all your meetings. 
MY Idea which thanks to its monitoring and statistics functions meets both these challenges.
I got the idea during a lean six Sigma session while thinking about the challenge of the IT and how can we enhance the interaction and facilitate the process of booking the meeting rooms.
Touch-screen solution to connect all meeting rooms globally and create a dashboard which shows the availability of every meeting room
Book conferences rooms easily and then have all information presented on the screen. Integrates seamlessly with the existing e-mail server.

Screen/Ipad will be outside each meeting room which will display the upcoming meetings during the day and there will be an option to book on time You would just have to input:
Number of people, time and date of meeting, and this application can suggest for you if this would be a suitable meeting room, or it can suggest for you another meeting room to book. 

Features:
• Red or green lights show availability
• Automatically release a room if occupants do not show up
• Book directly on the screen for ad hoc or get an overview of what other rooms are free


Each employee would log in using their SSO credentials so that they can synchronize the date and time on their calendars.

Employees can still book thee meeting rooms through their email and it will automatically reflect on the room’s schedule. 

System will be connected to the unified platform for EMC IT.
