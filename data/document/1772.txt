Project Orientation for Delivery
The suggest phase to be added in the services delivery project will help drive productivity, clarity, right expectations and business effectiveness and accordingly will offer significant cost savings and better customer experience.
As EMC gets involved into more complex projects with complex scope (including integration, SW development, ..etc) and involving many stakeholders (IR and business), I found that most project managers at EMC are still managing the projects the same way traditional infrastructure projects have been managed in the past, and that's why I thought that we should include more controls and manage these new and more complex projects in a similar way to the consulting and system integration projects. 
The proposed solution is to introduce in the projects' implementation methodology a "project orientation phase" for large projects (>200K$). During this phase, a project planning document should be prepared by the project managers (EMC & customer jointly) to define the scope, approach, deliverables, milestones, reporting, resources, roles & responsibilities related to the project. After completing the document a project kickoff meeting to be scheduled with the presence of all stakeholders and sponsors where the content of the document is presented and discussed. This should be a mandatory phase in large projects with proper governance from PMO and management.
By implementing the project Orientation phase, we will have all involved parties and stakeholders on the same page from the beginning of the project. This will lead to more clarity, less conflicts and less rework and better profitability. This will also lead to better proposals and sizing for future projects as the account manager will be involved in orientation phase and it will represent the formal handover in the presence of all stakeholders.
