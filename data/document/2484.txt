EMC supply chain risk management tamper evident tape.
Use of tamper evident tape for all EMC packaging would significantly improve the distribution and installation of our products across the globe as well as reduce EMC's liability in terms of missing order items as part of the MWD process.
It would also con
Multiple MWD's were received in the past with the items missing out of boxes. It was very difficult to prove whether the missing item left the factory or was the box tampered with during transit.
To safeguard the contents of boxes EMC could apply tamper evident tape instead of the current standard sealing tape. 
Any attempt to open the package or tamper with the tape will leave a clearly evident residue. This tape cannot be resealed.
Solution should significantly reduce EMC's liability for missing item transferring it onto the carrier in turn improving the TCE. 
Provided the idea is fully implemented across the range of EMC products I see improvement in the amount of MWD complaints we receive. Ultimately it would improve customer satisfaction as well as reduce the fulfillment cost.
