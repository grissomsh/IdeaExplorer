GS family together

Come up this idea when I see the Global Services Challenge.
1.Job rotation for outstanding employee from different site/country.
-- Can enhance the communication between different  site/country within GS family.
-- Can share successful experience.
2.Hold some games annually around all GS family.  
  For example, can hold a singing game.
  Step1, Everyone in GS family could upload their demo to an internal website.
  Step2, GS member can vote.
  Step3, The winner of each site/country could have a live show together.
  In addition, the speech games or other suitable games could be held the same way.
