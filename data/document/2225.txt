HR Application Portal 
This application will help reduce the time, Paper work, Cost needed when recruiting an employee. 
The Application is already a successful application used in some multi national companies, EMC2 would benefit alot if it was included as a smart technique for HR. 
My solution is a HR Application that would help the HR Department and department managers to minimize the time and effort needed for the interviewing process, it already includes the Questions that might be needed, Places to add comments and rate the candidate. The application will also be categorizing and arranging the candidates depending on the outcome of the interview. 
The application will be reducing alot of time spent rather than the normal process, The cost will be also reduced as the head counts will be not increasing when HR uses a smart application and the process will be minimized up to 80%, The interviewer will find all the information they need through the application which will make the interview much easier and straight to the point, ratings will be ready as soon as the interview ends, Hiring will fully depend on the rating and their arrangement rather than favorites,
