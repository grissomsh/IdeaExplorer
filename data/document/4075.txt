The Smartest EMC Employees

Innovation Session
Now sometimes it is very hard to tell which are the smartest employees and how you can use that for EMC's best interest. There could be some tests to be taken voluntarily by EMC Employees (IQ, EQ, analytical skills, observational skills,...)  with some very tough questions that only few over smart Employees can answer. The top scoring Employees should be reconsidered for better job positions after going through a series of other tests/interviews in order for EMC to benefit from them more (given they are already in normal or underqualified positions)
