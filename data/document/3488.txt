 EMC “VMS” for <15K Market – a Virtualized Mini StorageBox to penetrate the low-end market

the idea came from the virtualization concept on commodity HW to cust cost
EMC will join a partnership with one of the local bendors in APJ Market to market and support the VMS arrays.
 
The idea works as follows : 

1-	VMware ESXi cluster will be connected to a Disk Array Enclosure (DAE)
2-	SAS disks of 900GB storage will be used for optimum performance
3-	ESXI cluster will serve IOs using its ISCSI and FC ports and adapters
4-	Data protection and replication is done virtually using VM cloning 
5-	UMI – Unified Management Interface will be used on top of Vmware Vsphere and EMC unisphere for ease of management
6-	Features and licenses are purchase on demand by the customer

This will leverage the benefits of VMware virtualized environments to penetrate new markets
