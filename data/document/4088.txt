Inbuilt Clone Feature in VPLEX.

Clone feature in VPLEX.
With Databases/critical environments hosted on luns allocated from VPLEX (with VMAX back-end), we always face a challenge to clone/create a copy of the data for any testing purpose.

Currently, we have 2 options:
Option 1:
- Remove storage volumes from Storage views of VPLEX.
- Run symclone in VMAX.

Option 2:
- Run the clone in VMAX.
- Run the cache-invalidate command in VPLEX for target volumes.

We need a feature which does the clone internally in VPLEX (with source and target as VPLEX luns).

Having this feature is always an advantage as we can clone any luns Irrespective of Technology.
