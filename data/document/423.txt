Melting Pot "a business game application"
Building an integrated team in business corporations help towards innovation 

i thought of this idea while i was a student on a project management course
i had a partner "Osama Aboelezz"

-we tried pushing the idea forward by doing a mobile app 
Presenting , Melting Pot, a business game application dedicated to team members within a business corporation in order to integrate into a fully coherent team for a better team performance.
Melting Pot sets rules and organizes real life challenges that are based on soft skills training models.
Melting Pot is to be played via multiple platforms, as laptops or smart phones, where it encourages team members to discover, experience, understand and enjoy sets of challenges designed on number of game theories and dynamics which make the whole experience serious but fun and challenging but safe.
my idea would improve team building skills which would reflect on innovation
