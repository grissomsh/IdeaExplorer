HR Challenge - Diversity and Innovation at a Great Place to Work
Already EMC is having technical talent and presence of EMC is all over the globe, hence EMC is already have diverse culture. Now, the question is how EMC can achieve - diversity and innovation?. In Simple words, Innovation is nothing but solutions to problems. Sometimes few innovations are already invented somewhere and they are not known to others until it actually required or relate. Now, how it can be achieve in EMC? As per me, this can be possible just by collaboration, communication & discussion of problems/issues repetitively with diverse resources of EMC over the globe in single virtual room. Of course awards and recognitions are matters to attract them. 
HP Virtual Room for internal team communication & priority calls.
Need to introduce single virtual room within EMC or EMC intranet & like you have showed your challenges for 2015 in innovation center, required to put all challenges in that room on daily basis, anybody from any where internally to EMC can see & put  challenges/issues/problems in that virtual room. this helps to first understand/aware/know problems/requirements anywhere in EMC. In this way process of thinking on problem get start.  We have already Innovation center page, but this page only get accessed more and more when employee come across the problem with more advertisement of the issues & problems. Make reference of that VM page on every EMC portal page which is internal to EMC like Inside EMC.
Note- Need to provide instructions within team before actually put idea in this VM room with the help of there existing leads. 
Most of the time single idea benefited to existing multiple projects& only some sort of changes and help it to save big cost.
 New innovation will be discussed and build innovative culture at EMC. 
 Benefits are depends upon the problem - It might be benefit to Cost, Time, Resource etc.
