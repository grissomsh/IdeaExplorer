Integrate Spanning(EMC Company for backing up SaaS applications) with XtremIO
It would be great to integrate Spanning with xtremIO for our SaaS application based customers. Spanning is the best backup solution for SaaS applications


Have read about Spanning reviews recently,http://spanning.com/resources/reviews/. and came up with this idea
Nearly 4,000 organizations have chosen Spanning to protect their critical data with backup for Google Apps and Salesforce, and that number is growing every day. 

So it would be great to integrate Spanning and XtremIO.
Increase in SaaS application Customers for XtremIO because of the Integration
