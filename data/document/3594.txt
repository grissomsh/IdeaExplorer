EMF Protection

I was reading about that on: http://www.globalhealingcenter.com/organic-living/emf-protection2.html
recommend in office space the Safe Space II. It is designed to neutralize harmful electromagnetic fields, as well as other detrimental vibrational energies in environments. It is a framed holographic grid (encased behind glass) 2” x 2” and can be attached to any surface…especially the computer monitor. The Safe Space II device clears a spherical area with a 9’ radius.
