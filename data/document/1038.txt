-New customer has no clue where to start( basic admin)
-When customer has multiple EMC product like RP and VPLEX and VNX, sometimes there are some ETAs related to certain combination, but customer don't know if it's related. 
In all those scenarios, CS has to send KB articles each time, sometimes in pdf attachment. Not easy for customer to search and maintain.
