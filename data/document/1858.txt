Merge Mainframe Data Collection tools
Make data collection easier for customers and therefore speed up problem resolution
IDea is a simple merging of two existing products
The two tools should be merged, taking the best functions from each, and the resulting code shipped with the MFE product (as EMCMGRAB is now)
Customers find collecting large numbers of logs and EMCMGRAB is a great tool to automate that.

GDDR is becoming installed at more sites and requires all the MFE logs and extra GDDR logs.  GDDRTRAP collects these but is currently non-GA.

Combining both products to a single data collection tool, that is easily run by the customer, would provide benefits to problem resolution.
