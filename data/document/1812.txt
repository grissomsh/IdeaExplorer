On swiping my badge entering a meeting room, I would love for all my meeting needs to be activated.
Enhanced use of our display screens would encourage a more contemporary cooler workplace. Depending on how far the solution can go, it could create a very modern and fun workplace with new and cutting edge ways to communicate and collaborate.
This idea was generated at an IT Idea Generation Session in Cork on 25th June.
I swipe my badge on the Facilities interactive touch pad. Automatically it does the following for me:
-Starts my meeting room booking
-Switches on the lights in the room
-Switches on the A/C to my preferred level
-The conference phone and video conferencing unit auto dial into my meeting (because my badge is connected to the room facilities and to my outlook calendar and web ex/MyBridge etc)

I know the one-click meeting solution is in progress of being analyzed and developed. This is new as it connects IT systems to Facilities systems.

A complete contemporary unified workplace experience (combination of IT and Facilities).
