Software defined data center for Durham Lab
Our idea is to address all of the challenges and make it a software defined data center (SDDC).  Software defined data center enables agile and efficient services and automated management. Virtualization is key to it. 
It addresses saving money and space, easy to build and setup configurations and templates, automated, monitors resources, notifies failures in the Lab, automatically opens lab tickets for failed scenarios.
I and Pranay discussed and brainstormed to get this idea.
The whole process can be automated with user interface. More description is in the attached document. Please refer to document.

This solution can be architected, designed and implemented in 6-12 months. If needed we can develop a simple prototype and proof of concept.
