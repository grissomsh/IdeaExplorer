Networker SR Creation 
Networker SR assignment Process takes  an average of 3.75 hours Time for collecting  Information, accept SR, and start troubleshooting.

Due to the lack of adequate SR creation template which is missing a lot of mandatory input And information/hints on what/how to get these required data input 

idea came from recognizing Number of Loops to start Troubleshooting the issue 

1. WFM attempt to assign to an available TSE , when SR is created and is placed in queue 
Time taken for WFM to ping and find a TSE who is willing to accept an ambiguous SR  
		 no problem troubleshooting yet 

2. WFM attempt to assign to an available TSE , when customer replies turns out it’s not in TSE skillset .,
Time taken for communication between TSE and customer to get an adequate problem description, 
Time taken for TSE to inform WFM it’s not in his/her skillset
		no problem troubleshooting yet 

3. TSE attempt to gather the required logs
Time taken for communication between TSE and customer to inform what logs are needed and how to gather them .
Time taken by customer to collect and upload logs to the SR 
		no problem troubleshooting yet 

4. TSE start Troubleshooting 

yellow belt project was submitted, however management decided not to invest in Salesforce( service Center)  for changing our SR creation Template . 

Reduce the average time taken for collecting Information, accept SR, and start troubleshooting in the Networker SR assignment Process from 3.75 hours to 10-15 minutes 

Build a proper fill-in template for SRs to be filled and submitted by SR creator with the minimum requirements to open a SR 
For example:
Product name and version 
Problem description
Error
Application being backed up
Logs ( basic application logs ) 
Availability time

Along with a tooltip to indicate how to find out where to get this information 
By measuring Average Time taken for collecting Information, accept SR, start troubleshooting
By reviewing Networker queue
TSE and WFM productivity to focus on queue rather than finding the proper skillset of an SR and finding a TSE who can work on that skillset 
Customer Satisfaction ,as a result number of Assignments will decrease significantly in IR (initial Response)
