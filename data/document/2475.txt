Configurable cipher algorithm on VNX/VNXe software
CTD Supportability in 12 Months or Less
TCE Challenge
Speed up the response time for security volubility issue
Came up the idea during the security summit on 6/11/2015. 
Just discussed with Xuan Tang briefly.
Make the cipher algorithm configurable. Customer can modify the configuration file, and avoid the software rebuild/deploy cycle. 
The encryption cipher algorithm is configurable by customer.
Can avoid one patch delivery due to the cipher algorithm security volubility issue.
Speed up the response time to handle the cipher algorithm security volubility issue.
It will improve customer
