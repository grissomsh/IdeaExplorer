Smart Business
Matches with "Egypt COE Smart City and IoT Challenge"
I came up with the idea after attending sessions on concepts of Big-Data &  IoT where I thought that combining the benefit  of both of them  would  produce a new way of doing business for big/medium/small companies, market stores & brands especially  in less-developed countries where relying on internet access can be an effective way of doing business away from the traditional ways that demotivates people from thinking of starting their own-business.  
"Smart-Business" idea is relying on the accessibility of internet that became a dominant component of our daily-lives and affordable to acquire along with the evolution H/W, S/W & Cloud Computing capabilities EMC2 is having (such as Big Data) to build a geographically-distributed real-time Database cloud with a Software mobile App that  can offer a new way of growing/encouraging business opportunities by building a mobile-version software that's linked to a real-time storage cloud that can be capable of integrating big market names on it and retain  their  customer records and analyse them to have a better understanding of customer's behavior, trends, their interests & needs so that  individuals can subscribe to that software App  and by tracking their location and compare it to the nearest store where they are occasionally interested to buy their goods, brands or other consumables an instant offers can be sent based on every individual records to encourage him/her to go and buy their favorite goods or consumables with more competitive prices. Thus, as an individual  with an internet mobile access being mapped through that mobile-software App he/she can always be motivated whenever they go to get their favorite goods or consumables in a discounted price to serve as an incentive for them to  be more satisfied, served quickly and for the companies and market stores integrated to that Smart Business tool have the opportunity to sell more of their goods, be easily located and serve a wide range of individuals/clients in many geographical sectors more effectively. Hence, business opportunities can be maximized with less marketing costs and start-up small business can scale-up their brand loyalty and their profits more easily than normal old-fashion methods. 
If it would be implemented based on geographical distribution utilizing real-time data collection + accurate analysis on customer/individual goods & consumables consumption behavior & purchase methods. Then that "smart business" tool/App would encourage most of companies with all sizes/markets/brands to be integrated to that "smart Business" solution which would be a game changer in terms of marketing their products, goods and positively lead to rapid increase in their sales, change customer trends, increase  customer loyalty  and from customer prescriptive will increase their satisfaction being always visible and offered what they prefer to buy and acquire in special prices with less time for them to spend on searching where to get what they need  with the best price.
