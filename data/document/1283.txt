Define Diversity...
Creating Workplace 2.0. This will generate diverse, multiskilled, multicultural, empowered employees. The idea widens EMC community, having everyone feel like one connected family.
Observations from involvement in activities across the COE from CSR activities, Give Back Time activities and communication activities in addition to IGS activity.
Idea promises Culture Events Week, where each day one culture/country runs events to allow EMC employees to network and experience colleagues cultures but also lead to knowledge sharing (ex. language classes). This idea solves the problem by allowing opportunity to come forward, showcase a language or cultural identity and share knowledge. An event of this kind would be different to other networking events as it should be run in a fun and informative way.
Improves Teamwork, Team Involvement, sense of Unity. Networking opportunities. Knowledge Sharing.
The Culture Events Week, could  showcase each day one culture/country. Series of  events would be run to allow EMC employees to network and experience colleagues cultures but also lead to knowledge sharing (ex. language classes). Canteen or culture teams could prepare national food, play music, cultural games or other activities that are typical for their own country. Full site networking event that allows people to share language, their culture and their knowledge.
