TL;DR decks for EMC products
The idea can help expose workers to the stack of solutions provided by the federation. 
We came up with the idea when as part of our jobs we wanted to learn more on different business units within EMC.
Our solution is a two-fold solution. The first level is to create a Federation platform map to show where each solution of the federation located at. The second level is to provide a deck / video on each solution that can provide several levels of overview on the solution. The different overviews can be from different levels. The Highest is a very general description, and the lowest gives a very deep dive at the details level.
The current decks / videos that exist for products are either too high level or too specific.

The benefit of the idea is that it will create a knowledge base that will help employees learn more on the solutions that exist in the federation. Each employee would be able to choose the level of details he/she would like to learn about the product.
