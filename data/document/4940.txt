Designer-friendly component cost information for design reference

In an effort to brain storming cost reduction idea, we found that multiple similar parts cost significantly differently.

For example, for below two capacitors, using 2x 22UF is considered equivalent to a single 47UF in most applications, however there is ~4x cost difference for different approaches.   
366-476-005 (47UF 20% 6.3V X5R 0805 PKG)  $0.12100 
366-226-000 (22UF 20% 6.3V X5R 0805 PKG)  $0.01790

If a user sees this data when he simply searches bulk capacitors in the database, he will most likely choose the 2x 22UF for a design and saves EMC cost. 
Currently the component database only record parts' functions and characteristics. Upon enquiry the database can list out a group of parts with similar feature or function. But they don't include any cost information. 

The only way for designer to retrieve that information is to look into the SAP or run the question to commercial team. However that is restricted to a certain list of components he/she has on in mind.

In many cases, the design can be minor tweaked to adapt to multiple parts. However with the limited knowledge of cost, as a result of unuser-friendly database,  obviously restricts the designer's ability to make the right choice upfront.

In order to achieve the end to end cost efficiency, it is as well, if not more, important to do a correct design upfront, than to drive the supply chain for a lower price for a given "unwise" part.
