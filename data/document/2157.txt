Develop and build a flexible rack up to 48U "The FlexiRack" to support current and future product offerings.
Drive down cost in EMC supplychain operations on current and future product offerings. Allow EMC a more cost competitive advantage in the Platform 2 and 2.5 arena as well and allowing EMC to position itself with a cost competitive advantage as we develop and release Platform 3 solutions.
Having responsibility for the rack suppliers in Europe, I noticed the requirement for racks greater than 40U in height that EMC's current supplychain cannot offer. By engaging the incumbent supplier in Europe, we reviewed together how we could develop a solution with minimal investment and cost to EMC. First evaluation is complete and we believe the idea has merit in terms of implementation and cost. The next stage is to develop a prototype for proof of concept.
Based on the current 40U Titan-D Rack offering, develop a stretchable version "The FlexiRack" that can extend to up to 48U. The design will reuse many of the existing fixtures/tooling in the supplybase currently used for 40U thus saving EMC significant tooling costs. The design will be be developed with an existing strategic incumbent rack supplier thus saving EMC significant develop costs.
Significant cost saving to EMC compared to existing 3rd party purchased offerings. Current 3rd party price approx $3000. FlexiRack cost approx $1200. This allows EMC greater competitiveness in its offerings and the savings can be used for investment in Platform 3 development work.
