Securing the future connected objects around us.
This idea submission is for the challenge "RSA IoT Challenge". With "Internet of Things" becoming a possibility, security becomes paramount concern to prevent unauthorized access which can lead to just not misuse but can become threatening to the owner of the device. Many connected devices have been proven to have security loopholes, leaving them vulnerable to hacking and potential data losses.
This idea came up to us from various sources predominantly publications from Shahid Raza et al. We are constantly bouncing our ideas to make a viable security solutions in the IoT arena.
The idea is to abstract out resource-expensive security implementation from these low computing devices and delegate the security features such as server authentication, authorization to a Gateway interfacing the communications to these devices. With majority of workload shifted to such distributed gateways, these devices will be left with minimal security implementations. Devices will be stripped off with the security tasks such as online SSL handshake, certificate management etc. We will exploit message-level security features over specialized COAP/DTLS communications.
IoT is predicted to be 9 trillion market and security is the biggest concern with no proven solutions available so far. Early starter like EMC, coming up with such solution can garner a big market share.
