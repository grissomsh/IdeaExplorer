Diversity and Innovation 
My idea will give the opportunity to the employees to be exposed to different cultures.
N/A
My idea:
Every month we will choose a country and we will try to learn as much as we can about this country.
*The above can be done through the following activities*
1- Decorate the desks and put words (10-20) on the walls (Bonjour, bonsoir, popular phrases about the country) in the meeting rooms for a month and then switch to another country the next month. In this month we will try to learn everything about the chosen country (food, arts, geography, music, sports, fashion, behaviours ,â€¦.)
This will give employees to live each month in a new environment and learn more about other cultures.
2-      Competition:
Motivate employees to read and learn more about different cultures, and make it as a game.
A game between 2 employees and the one who wins will move to the next step.
The last step will be tele presence between one employee from cairo COE  and the other one from Hopkinton. The one who wins will get a reward.
This will motivate employees to read and learn more about different cultures.
It will raise the spirit of motivation and competition between employees.
It will engage employees from Cairo and Hopkinton to activities together.
 The above is a brief idea about the concept, however i am available to provide detailed action plan and fully support in the implentation.
 

It will benefit the company as it will increase the employees exposure to new and different cultures, their languages, their behaviours and their lives.
