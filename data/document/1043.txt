Video Recording of Lectures during BootCamp training
N/A
I came across the idea during my BootCamp days. Videos were shared (for e.g ISM videos) but they were on-line ILT's from different trainers.A common link for the whole class to upload videos would greatly help the whole process.
Many trainees do take videos in their smartphones. But the drawback in this scenario is that you may/may not do it for every topic as we do not know the importance of every topic prior to its teaching. And also, since it’s not official, most of the trainees do not take it seriously enough to share it. If someone’s video taking machine is turned on before the lecture starts every day and a common link of sharing the videos is taken care of, trainees might refer it while studying at home for the exams, when there is not much time to refer to all the portions of the books.
This would assure good understanding of the concept and in turn good results from the trainees.
