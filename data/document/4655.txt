Use Node.js to implement cpu insensitive scenario for mobile

I have been playing with Node.js for sometime and currently I am writing Node.js code to build an automation job for our IPOA team. During my work, I am inspired by the powerful ability that Node.js dealing with IO sensitive scenarios, especially cpu insensitive scenarios. 
For cpu insensitive scenario, if we implement it using session pool, we would frequently switch between threads. However, maintaining so much threads is memory-cost, and context switch cost time. 
Node.js suggests user to achieve that by asynchronize programming (e.g Event-driven or Promise/Deferred pattern) within a single thread, which is more efficient.
Also, Node.js service can easily scale out, so single thread risk can be avoid by multi process structure.
