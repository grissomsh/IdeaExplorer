Another quick support add on
To provide additional level of reporting to customer and more interactive relation with support and support eServices
Sometimes we still surprise customer onsite, that we are informing about open SR done by DH.
We could go a step further and also notify by SMS when a Dial Home is received under SEV1 and SEV2 or S7M and S7H
It is great for customer awareness, specially on ESRS that often a reboot is required.
the SMS would also trigger a EMAIL to the registeres USER EMAIL and informing a SR progresso and EMC survey
i propose a ease Short message texting solution, triggered by HW cal homes, for Sev 2 and Sev1, or S7M and S7H
customer will have more feedback and can consult further on ios / android devices, or trough support.emc.com
Addicionally a QR code, reader added to the Support app EMC provides, could read a QR code, EMC prints on the EMC cabinets installed @ customer. Customer would, if just using the app, check at any time, on any of theyr systems if a Open SR exists
the succes would be measureable on the surveys replyed with SMS trigger added.
it is planned to increase customer awareness of EMC working SEv1 and SEv2 SR that are caused by HW failures
