Think outside the box

Marketing doesn't have to be limited to press ads and radio jingles. Why not think outside the box? If you own an It Company why not dress up as one of the companies products for example ( a VNX,Symmetrix..ETC)and hand out Flyers? You'll probably get photographed and get some good exposure on social media! Marketing doesn't need to be boring, it can be fun and creative!
