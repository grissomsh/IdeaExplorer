Leveraging HDFS compression with ViPR 

This idea was generated by Andres DeCorral - FL Enterprise SE.  One of his customers has leveraged Hortonworks distribution to store database backups in compressed format.  They realized signficant space savings with this approach.  With ViPR this capability would bring significant benefits to existing storage environments - leveraging EMC/non-EMC/commodity storage.
1. Leverage HDFS presented by ViPR.
2. Addition of HDFS compression.
3. HDFS client to write database files to compressed HDFS/ViPR stream.
