Grab the Low-end Market Share with VNXe by Lowering the Cost in Design/Manufacturing/Integration

Came up with this idea when Lenove made M&A to IBM server.
Lower the cost of VNXe from the design:
a. Multi-level storage design, we can use tape, HDD, SSD(flash)...; while store the data according the use frequency -- store the most used date in flash, then HDD, then tape...
b. Reduce Pre-installed disks and reserve slots for user to extend
c. Using ARM CPU to replace intel CPU, now ARM CPU is already used on server side
    there's no reason we cannot use ARM CPU on our storage server, especially for the low-end market

on Business aspect, there are 2 suggestions:
a. Bring the manufacturing from US to China Mainland, maybe we can use OEM like Foxcon
b. We can also Bind/Integrate our storage server with calculating/application server; Customers buy the storage server not just to make them work alone, but work with PC server; is it possible for us to buy a PC server and integrate the PC server and our storage server to a unified one for sale? Also, our ally Lenovo made M&A to IBM's server -- can we use this opportunity?
Cooperation with Lenovo can also reduce the bad effect by that those days Chinese government imposing restriction on government departmentsâ€™ business orders to foreign e-class devices.
