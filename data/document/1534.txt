EAS can be optimized 
Currently, we need to enter the date by ourselves. 
We should follow the data format as 29.06.2015.
It's not simple enough.
I suggest when we choose the date box, a calender can pop up.
We can choose the data easily.
Except this, If the EAS can merge into outlook.
We can easily see who are not available.
When i first use EAS, I spend a lot of time to figure out how to input the date.
add popup calender when choosing date.
1: It's popular that we choose date by clicking calender. 
It's simple and easy.
2: If it can be merge into outlook,We can easily see who are not available. 
No need two system.
