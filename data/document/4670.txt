EMC's Energy Saving Lamps

The idea came to me when the TV programs was talking about the benefits of that electrical bulbs usage and how much energy will be saved in Egypt after using them.
EMC can help in solving this problem by many means, either by manufacturing the energy saving lamps, importing them, or marketing for the use of it under the name of EMC which increase the awareness about EMC and a way of marketing for it as well. These Energy Saving Lamps are better than the general ordinary lamps that are used by most of the people and companies as they give the same amount of visible light, it uses one fifth to one third of electrical power and last eight to fifteen lifetime longer, generate light with a low amount of electricity so they are extremely energy efficient. Besides, the cost of the electrical bills will be reduced afterwards and a huge amount of energy saving which reduces the excessive cut of electrical power that we face a lot nowadays.
