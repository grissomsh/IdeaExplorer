Price Discrimination Application
The app will take in text from social media and give recommendations about customer discounts or premiums for future sales.
I graduated in economics and have been thinking about price discrimination models for a long time. It is difficult to convert consumer surplus to producer surplus without knowing much about the client, but with the advances in big data technology we are able to capture more accurate demographic information. Many people have trouble seeing how big data and customer insights will equate to something of business value. Being able to understand how a client is valuing something allows you to price goods and services to maximize revenue as they price will differ from client to client.
Develop an application that will ingest text language from the listening posts, apply a deciphering algorithm, and determine in which demographic the client belongs, either Normal or Unmotivated. After the categorization is made, premiums or discounts are applied accordingly. The motivation is to discover if there is a pattern of wording in the review that will indicate true decision-making motivations for the client. For application development, begin with using Python Scikit, or another vectorization tool, to handle the text vectorization of the reviews and apply to a kernel machine learning algorithm. Also, investigate Fisherâ€™s Information algorithm to better score the categorization accuracy.
Success would be measure on significant increases in revenue based on the new pricing schema.
