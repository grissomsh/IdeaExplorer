Reusable Printer Papers

Innovation Session
Lots of times people print a lot of stuff and use up a huge am ount of papaer, sometimes the printer crashes and just prints old stuff that people do not need anymore. What if I want to print something and I do not care if the back of this paper has other stuff printed on it? There should be a tray especially made for this. This saves money and material.
