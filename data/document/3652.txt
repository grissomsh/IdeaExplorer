Paper ESD Bags

James Fields, from Celestica, mentioned KnowCharge’s paper ESD bags on a call with Michael Norbeck and Frances Douglas in January 2014. Michael Norbeck and Frances Douglas then introduced Laura Nelson to KnowCharge’s product line. Laura Nelson, Michael Norbeck and Frances Douglas have had a call with KnowCharge and have received samples. Samples are currently in the Materials Science Lab with Michael Sosnowski for testing to see if the KnowCharge paper ESD bags will meet EMC’s specs. 
A paper ESD bag produced by KnowCharge would be readily recyclable, eliminating the traditional ESD bag waste stream. Paper ESD bags can also be custom printed, creating an additional opportunity to education our customers on EMC’s sustainability efforts. Additionally, recyclable ESD bags would assist in meeting EMC’s public 2020 packaging goals.
