Light Weight Web Application for Documentum
Webtop and other WDK applications have been heavy platform to access Documentum repositories and also web UI is very much restricted to OOTB available, except xCP but this also have been bit heavy application.
Since we were facing problems with webtop and continuous request from customers to provide website like UI and portal integration with similar web design, it was difficult to give the same with Webtop in 2010 - 2013... then xCP was introduced which has provided some relief to satisfy customer. But, that was not so easy to integrate with Mobile platform. Finally thought of building something different that could be platform independent and easy to develop and GUI as website like feel.
Custom RESTFul Services, Spring MVC Framework, Mobile Wrapper. Custom RESTFul Services are designed to get information from Documentum Repository. Spring MVC Framework communicates with RESTFul Services with AES encrypted information to receive data and show on screen (only required data has been provided to the application). Mobile wrapper is using the same Spring MVC based application to use as Mobile application, that too platform independent.
The application has been build as on draft version with providing read-only features of Webtop, similar like EMC Mobile application for iOS. Also was able to provide AES based encryption that would be key based verification. Front end is very easy to build, even this product could be used in Android, iOS and windows platform.
