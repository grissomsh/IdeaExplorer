Using EHC, Isilon and VCDriver to execute VM migration between Vmware and openstack efficiently 
The idea provide a new solution to migrate virtual machines between vmware and openstack. By using EMC EHC, Isilon and VCDriver, customers can move virtual machines from different cloud infrastructures even without data move, if they are using EMC's storage infrastructure beneath VMware and openstack, we can provide a reliable quick solution than other solutions 
The idea is from the consideration of data migration in hybrid cloud environment, last week I heard that FICO planned to migrate some VMs from vmware to openstack and then started thinking how to do it quickly. If customers are using EMC storage infrastructure, vmware and openstack both upon it, vmware and openstack act as host but EHC act as backend array, in this situation the best solution is to move data from backend array but not host sides. Later I checked current componentss of EHC and found there is no Isilon, which is key component as data laker, so I raise this solution in the end. 
My idea is to perform data migration by using EMC storage layer solution, to avoid unnecessary data copy if both vmware and openstack are running on EMC EHC infrastructure. the basic workflows for data migration are: 1) check whether target VMs are running on EMC isilon array, if yes, jump to step#4 directly; 2) using ViPR to provisioning a file share on Isilon to target vmware ESX; 3) backup VMs using Avamar and Datadomain, which  are part of EHC components, to exported file shares; 4) Isilon act as a data laker, which get image of VMs via NFS interface, then export same file share to openstack infrastructure by openstack swift; 5) after getting the images on openstack, recover those VMs by VCDriver(VCenter Driver powered by vmware); 6) migrate VMs to different location like KVM by openstack Nova migration technology, make them running in the end.

Because this solution will keep data on Isilon data laker, no matter is for vmware or openstack, it's avoid data copy from different infrastructures and raise efficiency and reliability of entire migration, even if VMs were not running on Isilon before, it can be copied to Isilon automatically by ViPR, Amavar and Datadomain technologies and reduce almost duplicate data, which is also a safe and quick solution. 
If this idea can be implemented fully, it provides a new solution to customers to setup their real hybrid cloud environment, no matter they want to use vmware, openstack or hadoop, it's easy to migrate computing and storage resources in different cloud infrastructures. Obviously it will bring new business chances to EMC because the only prerequisite of this solution is to use EMC EHC as backend cloud solution.
