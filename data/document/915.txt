Pothole Reporter and analyzer
This idea this is to make our city smart with identifying trend and using general public to report issues.  
use the biggest resource available which is Human. Also it will benefit company with storage system sell as green plum and Pivotal to give App option
The solution is to have a free app which with GPS enabled . if the person is near pothole , he can just tap on app and app sends coordinates to central system (which can be emc storage with analysis capability ) . This system can do 2 kind of trending: 
1) how close potholes are there so government can plan filling easily 
2) how many people are reporting so they can prioritize the work 
For me access is to put a trending report which shows after reporting , how many days it took to fill the pothole.  it will make money for EMC by building App which Pivotal can do and hosting in EMC storage solution  .
