GSAP EMC Awareness Program 

I being a GSAP faced this issue and wanted to highlight this at appropriate platform.
During the GSAP Bootcamp Program there can be a day in every week wherein the GSAP'ers have a session which introduces them about the Business Units. This will help a new employee to understand the way EMC works. 
* One day should be dedicated to know about the Business units. Eg: Role about each BU's and Departments.
* One day for EMC Products.
* Introduction/Interaction with various teams and its team members.
