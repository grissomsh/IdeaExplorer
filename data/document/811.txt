One IT as a Service platform across all EMC Labs
EOS2 is consolidating all the Labs and trying to build a Common Engineering Cloud. This idea will help in the same.
This idea came from a customer use case. We have worked with a customer where they were facing a similar challenge of trying to offer a single self service portal for deployments across their labs located in different geo's leveraging the infrastructure in those labs.
VMware's vRealize Automation is a highly customizable cloud management tool being offered as part of EMC's enterprise hybrid cloud. We can 
1. Add VMware, Hyper-V, Citrix Zen, KVM, Bare metal server endpoints from each of the labs, enable deployments in these labs thereby effectively utilizing the infrastructure in those labs
2. Provide a single service catalog and enable the deployment to happen across the labs depending on from which region the user is requesting for the service. Be able to choose/pick the networks accordingly. The templates/blueprints can thus be centrally managed.
3. Using entitlements ensure that a user is seeing only what he is entitled to see in the service catalog.
4. We can offer IaaS, Hadoop aaS, Datalake (EHC integrated with Federated data lake), PaaS (EHC integrated with PCF connector) etc in one service catalog.
4. Use vCenter orchestrator we can provide additional services and even build additional features like a configuration management database.
A single cloud across COE's would bring in resource utilization efficiency, single user interface, faster time to deployments and better governance. Like they say - Drink your own Champagne, we can showcase this to customers as part of our Enterprise Hybrid cloud story.
