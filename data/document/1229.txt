CTD Horizontal Program Model
Our proposal improves alignment of cross-product and cross-functional program teams, including global services, resulting in an enhanced experience for our customers.
Experience on programs like ProtectPoint has demonstrated the need for a more centralized governance and empowered PMT to drive decisions across the business units to improve cross-product and functional alignment, bringing coordinated products to market quicker, with improved TCE. The Horizontal model has been discussed within Global Program Management, DPAS Engineering, Program management & product management, reviewed with several BU GMs, and a pilot started on ProtectPoint.
The Operating Model we are proposing provides clear definition of the Program Governance model, the charter of Horizontal program team members, and most importantly the Roles and Responsibilities for the key players in order to improve cross-product and cross-functional alignment. We are looking to empower the Horizontal PMT and identify a single owner from each function that will be responsible, at the Horizontal level, for leading and driving consensus, planning and execution across verticals for their functional area. We will identify a Sponsoring BMT and an Executive Sponsor for every given horizontal to ensure we have a designated owner for the overall success of the program. 

There currently is not a common framework to manage cross-product, synchronous delivery, but it is ad hoc and best effort. Our proposal clearly defines accountability and expectations for teams engaged in these types of programs.

TCE will be improved as products will be better aligned and come together long before the PO. Teams will be more productive as executive alignment will increase on “co-owned” offerings and PMTs will manage less re-work. Our cross-team engagement model overall will be improved and consistent across delivery teams, getting us closer to One EMC.
