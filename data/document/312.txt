Rotational Program within the COE
This idea will help better understanding of the employees for the functionality of other Business units.
There are some departments that i have no clue what is their functionality and how they serve customers.
My idea is to create a new program where any employee can apply in it and ask for a certain department where he can have a week training in that department so he can learn what they exactly do and how other departments serve the customers.
1-Getting to know other employees from different Business units.
2-Getting to know the functionality of other departments.
