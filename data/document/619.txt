DHOME & CLM_SRM Duplicate Microcodes in IB
The idea was addressed as a Lean Six Sigma project in order to capture the value it brings in terms of time and cost savings.
The results are impacting many entities, and thereby affecting CSAT.
The idea came after realizing the issue is recurring in the Install Base (on daily basis in massive amounts) and discussing its impacts with BTG team.
After brainstorming with BTG team and system developers, we decided to correct the logic of the  Backend package emccsi_bb_instance_pkg through Work Request#  372488 and running a cleanup project on the current duplicate microcodes in IB through Work Request# 371951 

A cleanup activity was run for the data until December 2014, the results were:
66727 duplicate microcodes were deleted from IB
9050 TLA microcodes are configured correctly with 100% accuracy and 0% errors.

Time Saving: 
Avg Microcode Terminate trx handling time = 1.7 mins
66727 x 1.7 = 113435.9 mins = 1890.6 man-hours (globally)

Cost Saving: 
- 1890.6 x $36 = $68,061 


The root cause fix is to be implemented in August 2015 as well as another wave of cleanup to ensure the issue is completely resolved
