Redis disk cache integration with EMC ExtremeIO using open source FLOCKER API
Involves open source and EMC product integration with a great impact on the Pivotal cloud foundry product road map. 

Uses Open source and EMC products across PCF, DOCKER, FLOCKER API and EXTREME IO for a greater benifit, which is prerequisite for the challenges tagged.

Context
----------
Redis is a disk backed, in memory database. The right way to use Redis is almost always to have enough RAM 

to fit all the data in memory. Still there are scenarios where this is not possible and In order to 

transfer data from memory to disk, Redis uses a swap file. In many configurations the swap file can be 

fairly large, amounting to 40GB or more.The data volume for hosting this file need to scale, perform and 

move along with container

Solution:
----------
1>Each container(Docker or PCF DEA) running the  REDIS instance is bound to a EMC ExtremeIO DATA VOLUME 

using  open source flocker AGENTS and  API.

https://docs.clusterhq.com/en/1.0.1/introduction/index.html

2> We use this data volume to store the disk cache for REDIS, ensures optimal memory CRUD performance.

3>With the Flocker API or CLI you can:

    Deploy a multi-container application to multiple hosts
    Move containers between hosts
    Attach and detach data volumes from containers as they change hosts
    Migrate local data volumes between servers 


Note:
A Flocker volume, called a dataset, is portable, and can be used with any container no matter where that 

container is running in your cluster.



Can impact any application that uses in memory cache with a  disk cache over flow.
Could be a great addition to Pivotal eco system.
Great use case for EMC EXTREME IO.
