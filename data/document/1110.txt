Code coverage and change set based regression test
  Lots of full regression test in branch team, regardless of scope of changes.
  This challenge makes test effort remain high for each full regression test.
  Our solution matches the challenge in that it can alleviate the pain, 
  by reducing test effort and preserving test efficiency
  1. small changes for a release will lead to a full regression test
  2. Branch QA team manager Henry Deng concieved that if we can utilize gcov data
     to reduce the sum of test cases run in regression test
  3. Henry orgnized a virtual team to do a POC
  4. After some investigation, we find it possible to do so
  1. run full regression test for a release
  2. collect function level code coverage for each test script
  3. store the mapping data collected in step 2
  4. get code change from given change set
  5. select test script by functions changed in change set
  6. run test script selected in step 5
  largely reduce the full regression test set to a small affected set.
  improve test efficiency and reduce effort on regression test
