Global Time & Materials Service Quality
Existing Service Improvement
Based on my own experience in the Time & Materials Team, I noticed that there is no accurate performance measurements while for a couple of years our performance was measured by the Quantity and NOT the Quality which doesn't show the real employee performance, and by consequences the employees are Not motivated as there is No recognition program based on their work.
The Solution is to create a Score sheet including guidelines to follow up inside the Service Request in addition to the Wiki Page application which contains all the Time and Materials Processes, and this will help increasing the T&M Quality and reduce the percentage of Customer escalations, the time spent using wrong processes. This will lead eventually to a well-established recognition program that will motivate the Team members; also this idea will help the management team to monitor the performance of each employee accurately.
- Decresing the DSAT.
- Decresing the Escalations regarding the wrong use of processes.
- Helping the management Team with an addition Quality tool.
- Helping the employees recognizing their own performance.
- Motivating the employees.
- Enhancing the Time&Materials productivity.
