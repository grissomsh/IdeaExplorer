DayCare on premises

As a new mom I see that this is a need.
If we dedicate an area inside the COE for a Daycare center where all working mom/dad who need to keep thier child and work without worrying about different reasons:
    - Waking up earlier to drop them to a daycare further away
    - Being restricted with the daycare's working hours so will have to leave earlier to pick them up.

This way the company will benefit from a dedicated employee, mom could return to work earlier from the maturnaty leave, and doesnt need to leave work earlier so more working hours.
