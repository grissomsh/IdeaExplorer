Boost virtualized server infrastructure performance with file server consolidation
virtualized server infrastructure. As such, seemingly minor adjustments and tweaks can ensure that a complex virtual environment maintains a high level of performance for users and clients.These configurations are applicable to all virtualized server environments. While some practices may seem small in scope, they can greatly affect your infrastructure performance.

As a result, administrators miss an opportunity to delete, consolidate and organize potentially unstructured data. So let's consider a slightly different approach to optimize file servers. One option is to use a storage area network (SAN) to perform file server functions. Many storage systems can serve as a Common Internet File System (CIFS) endpoint on a network for an easy connection to an Active Directory domain. This method virtualizes all of your file servers.
With this approach, you should allocate approximately 10% of your file server storage to local machines and archive the other 90% in the cloud. From a functionality standpoint, a virtual file server presents the entire storage contents as if it were stored locally on your network. Furthermore, a virtual file server can connect to Active Directory.
