Credit Card Protection

I got several transactions on my credit card that do not belong to me.
Have a tocken integrated to the credit cards in one of the following ways for internet payement:
1) have the credit card number change periodically
2) have the security code change
3) have a mobile app where you enter your credit card details during online payement and the application generates a security code for authentication.
