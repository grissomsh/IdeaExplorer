GS Technocrats

what better way to have fun and learning at the same time.
To bring the whole GS family together how about a Techno quiz every year.

1. Two level Quiz
At level 1:- Intra CS, PS and MS quiz.
At Level 2:- Top team from each CS,MS and PS battle out for the upltimate winner.
2. Considering the Global GS teams, we can have a Level 3, where top teams from all the GEO's will participate.

Pros:- It will bring CS,MS and PS on a same platform
-- It will create intrest among the engineers to keep themselves updated.
-- A sense of Team building among engineers
-- In the end, a happy engineer means a happy customer.

Note:- This need not be a Technical quiz, but can be something related to EMC organization or may be on general awareness.
