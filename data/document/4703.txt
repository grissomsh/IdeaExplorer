Test Plan Optimizer (TPO) based on ‘Test Analytics’ for Quality Products

The idea was formed when we had multiple reorgs in my team and we had to re-plan on a continuous basis with the limited resources available. We had to come up with the tests we needed to remove and still get good coverage and we painstakingly had to look through previous cycles and releases. With this new tool we can easily plan the right tests to choose for the resources available. When a test is selected it should have the history of how many times it has been run previously and what the status was and associated AR’s produced by the test. This tool will highly benefit project managers, resource managers and program team.
Currently we have all the tests in the test management system that we have run for the past releases for all the different functional and system tests. If we need to look up the history of the tests we need to go to each release and cycle to get status on the tests. For managers/leads to select the tests for next release intelligently they need to do their own analysis of previous releases. This new tool will mine the data and get the details of the test status, AR’s found, and number of executions in a given release and other releases, executions across multiple groups and products, etc., and pick the right tests for the next release/cycle
