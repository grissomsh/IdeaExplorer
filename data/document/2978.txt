Customer Intelligence and Sentiment - https://inside.emc.com/ideas/3327
Utilize Pivotal's Customer Savvy internal application to collect and analyze both structured and unstructured data.  This solution provides various insight into customers that include SR tickets, IB data, Dial home data, and and many other sources.
The idea initiated from a trip to visit with Pivotal along with Ed Jones and meeting with Ben Wu.  The discussion was around how we could utilize a tool to identify the value of customer intelligence data that Pivotal has been developing.  Since that initial meeting, a cross Federation group with Peter Southland (EMC) and Ben Wu (Pivotal) have been working on getting the VNX customer data into a SaaS based model hosted within Pivotal to replace the current customer PDF files that is created today.  
The current solutions do not seem to be scalable, are not consolidated across product groups, do not provide interactive or mobile capabilities and does not analyze unstructured and structured data to provide a customer sentiment.  The solution can be a centralized repository for consolidating customer information to get a true picture of the customer.  A sentiment can be calculated using adjustable algorithms to meet different BU needs.  The tool can provide true analytic vs. providing a static report.  Executives will be able to get near real time information accessible on their mobile devices vs. walking into a customer with a 50 page document that only includes one product.  Utilizing this tool can assist in the a federation sell if we import customer data from across the federation.  Other thoughts include providing this tool to sell higher level predictive support by importing customer log files and identifying key analysis.
Success is when we provide anyone visiting customers with near real time information encompassing structured and unstructured internal and external data to understand a true customer sentiment.
