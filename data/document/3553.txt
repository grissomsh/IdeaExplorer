 “Towards 3rd platform Path” – a training path to get ready for the transformation.

 The idea came up from the third platform transformation announcements allover EMC. We were thinking about how to get the employees ready for such change


 The idea is to have a training path that can be a part of the education center as well. This training path provides the employee with the skills and knowledge needed to cope the transformation.

This training path can be divided into 4 main tracks towards the 3rd platform :
1-	Big Data
2-	Cloud
3-	Social Media
4-	Mobile Applications

This enables complete readiness among EMC employees for the 3rd platform transformation which will enable EMC to lead that change through its skilled man power
