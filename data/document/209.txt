Ready-to-use booking/configuration Engine (BCE) for any datacenter infrastructure; VSPEX/VCE/OpenStack/Microsoft Hyper-V / Oracle / Citrix/ VNX / VMAX / IBM / HP / NetApp / ScaleIO / VSAN / Docker / EVO:RAIL / EVO:RACK, etc.  
CTO-Challenge Time-to-Market. Operating inside the customer's firewall, BCE gathers the customer's customized/standardized server, network and/or storage configuration data to automate infrastructure booking and deployment. E2E-Challenge  End-to-End. Process driven from order-to-delivery.  This is the any-network/any-server/any-storage version of innovationcentral.corp.emc.com/#menu_view_ideas?id=2015000263 that leverages existing call-home ports to export server, network and storage settings. Using this same mechanism, EMC could offer infrastructure configuration as a Service. 
This is a spin-off of a previous idea; innovationcentral.corp.emc.com/#menu_view_ideas?id=2015000263.  The previous innovation relied on the federation and the federated partners (vmware, EMC, VARs, etc.) working together to provide the Value-Added-Reseller(VAR)/Service-Provider(SP) Booking Engine (VSPBE).  This solution is much more open and can be adapted to work as suggested or to be customized to work for just automating server/compute or just storage booking and configuration.  Any vendor because it uses standard call-home as the means to get thru the firewall and as such any vendor offering call home functionality could buy the solution from EMC.  Imagine a customer with HP or IBM servers using EMC's Self-Service BCE to order via HP/IBM's call-home, 5 ready-to-use servers with configuration identical to the one BCE was run on. Identical everything BIOS, Golden image, etc. Imagine EMC receiving requests for VNX's having identical configurations/LUN layout as the one BCE was run on. 
Eliminate idle time by configuring customer's network, server and/or storage during manufacturing burn-in and then send the ready-for-customer-use solution. Let's make ordering and automatically configuring infrastructure as easy as ordering from In-N-Out Burger.  First you have a fixed(limited) menu and small, medium or large sizes to choose from. For now, every order must include servers, network and storage and will be delivered in an EMC rack.  SE(s) leverage presentations and tools they normally would to size and sell solutions for server/network/storage and once sold on solution, they inform customer of our ready-for-use deployment feature.  In this presale's step, the SE and the customer run a customized/simplified small, medium or large VSPEX/VCE-like product installation simulator/qualifier.  The information entered into the simulator is used to register customer with SP, assign and to configure the infrastructure purchased.  Advanced features will include the ability customize the configuration with golden boot images, apply ESXi Host Profile and even add DR or Big Data Extensions for Hadoop environments.  Secure transfer of this BCE data can be done by leveraging ESRS/Call-home functionality which already has dedicated paths in and out of the customers environment. 
BCE is a versatile tool.  It can be used in a customer self service mode to conveniently place upgrade orders or for new orders that are delivered using their company's standards. Key is customer is booking/ordering a specific configuration that is ready-to-use just as fast food restaurants provide food that is ready to eat. Just-in-time configuration and reduction in OPEX via automation and standardization. Makes EMC P2-to-P3 solutions easy for customers to order.  More efficient use of time/burn-in-process.  Enables customer to have customized, ready to use solutions delivered to their door step and for EMC to receive a transaction fee via the sale of CBE licenses to vendors for hardware EMC doesn't sell.  Imagine EMC getting a transaction fee for a customer buying a NetApp disk upgrade.  Modularized and adaptable to any vendor, any network, any storage or any server.  By simply using EMC's patented BCE, customers will be able to buy storage, network or servers already customized as they desire as easy as texting a message
