Vi(PR)PLEX : ViPR embedded with VPLEX for LUN Aggregation across Physical Storage Arrays
This idea aims at improvising the capabilities of ViPR by working in conjunction with VPLEX to offer a robust Software Define Storage
This came up during our brainstorming session on the research for ViPR’s current capabilities & limitations.
With ViPR controller embedded on a VPLEX, the LUN aggregation across Physical Storage Arrays can be made possible. VPLEX being in the Data Path, will help ViPR abstract both Control & Data Path Layer.
This will allow ViPR not only manage multiple arrays through a single interface but also make the efficient use of Storage Resources. This will also help in LUN aggregation across multiple arrays and thereby improving the capacity utilization.
This can be the next Roadmap item for ViPR because this makes ViPR a robust product for Software Defined Storage

1. This will make ViPR a truly Software Defined Storage product & helps extend EMC’s lead in this space
2. Abstracting the Data path layer will help efficient use of Storage Space through LUN aggregation across multiple arrays
