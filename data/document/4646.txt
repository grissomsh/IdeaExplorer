STOP BUYING  PACKAGING

We have deployed reuseable packaging solutions to varying degrees of success where we buy the packaging 1st day and the supplier collects and recycles the packging for re-use . The model works OK but falls down if the packaging wears quickly or is damaged in the supplychain plus the supplier has no accountability toward the number or turns we get from the pack. If we adopt this model then the supplier has a vested interest in getting the packaging to function as many times as possible so they get a return on their investment . 
Identify suitable products produced close to point of use , work with packaging provider to develop a re-useable packaging solution which they will own & manage and we pay them per use of the packaging rather than paying for a full new or refurbished pack each time.
