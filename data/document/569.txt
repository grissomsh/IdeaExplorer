Customer Centric Experience
The customer centric project will leverage a range of online forums & discussion boards data to predict and enhance our overall customer interactions. GBS would look to launch a creative method to share solutions and tools across the federation that would result in a better customer experience.
This idea evolved from a brainstorming session held by GBS in Ballincollig with all the below mentioned employee's present. We have not discussed this idea since it was noted in the session.
There would ideally be a landing portal that will enable the customer to select from a data tree, the idea of this is to capture the clicks and predict customer behavior within the websites in the federation. Depending on selections, the customer, partner or internal user would get routed to the corresponding location within the federation. With analytics on the click through path and potential next steps like whitepaper downloads or forum posting inside the Federation websites, we will be able to build a complete customer profile that can help us better understand and potentially predict customer requirements, common requirement requests or search items. 
This project would be deemed a success if when we can establish a clear link between customer data search ability today versus a potential implementation that includes predictive outcomes based on similar profiles searching for data using similar search criteria. The benefits should allow us to build company profile requirements at a user level, streamline user experience and increase TCE across the federation.
