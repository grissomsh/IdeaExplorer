Predictive analytics from VMAX log and other telemetry data 
This idea looks at leveraging the every decreasing cost of storage and compute by storing and analyzing telemetry and log data generated by the VMAX ecosystem using Federation products and capabilities leading to the creation of valuable insights and trends that were hitherto unavailable.
This idea has been in discussion for some months among members in our team. We have looked at understanding what is the telemetry information being produced by VMAX, what more needs to be obtained and how this can polished and stored.
A solution that envisages the creation of a data lake of VMAX performance, telemetry and log data upon which data mining algorithms can be run to generate predictive analytics on multiple dimensions of VMAX. 
Apart from log data, some of the important data / metrics that could be fed to the data lake would be:
•	Configuration information like Allocated and Consumed space, SLO levels, FAST statistics. 
•	Performance metrics like IOPS, utilization and bandwidth.
•	Other information like Disk types, Port types, Spare drives, Available DAE etc, Hotspots around ports and disks.
•	Alert information generated for various system component faults like Disks, cache, FRUs and DAE.
Solution elements:
•	VMAX telemetry and log data is sent back on an everyday basis to EMC. This could be around 50 to 100 MB log data per VMAX per day.
•	This date is then cleaned, polished and fed to a Pivotal HD database. 
•	Use Pivotal Hawq / RapidMiner (Rapid Miner Radoop)/ Direct MapReduce to provide the data mining and data analytics required. 
•	Use Tableau as a means of providing visual analytics to users.
•	Data for the last 3 years to kept, after which it is removed.

In order for a heterogeneous data center as a whole to gather metrics and form a larger Data Lake, we need infrastructural support from each array and this is a necessary step for VMAX that can be extended to others.
This would provide valuable insights into how the array is used by our customers in real time, what are frequent error conditions, trends in usage etc. allowing us to more agile in anticipating and fulfilling customer needs ultimately resulting in higher customer satisfaction.
