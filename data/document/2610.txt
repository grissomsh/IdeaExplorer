Cross-Federation Job Rotation
The Ireland COE has an issue that there are multiple locations for the EMC federation, so in order to help get the interrelated issues between the federation sites resolved and understood, Cross-Federation Job rotation might come in handy.
There is no history for the idea.
The solution is to determine and gather information about the departments or the intersecting business units across the federations and start a rotation program between the employees of the corresponding business units.
If implemented it will help employees to get to know their coworkers and gain a larger understanding of what they do and the scope of their duties and how they can work together to produce a better output.
