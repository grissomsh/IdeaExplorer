Colourful Workplace 
To create the workplace and therefore workforce of the future
Visited a friend in his workplace in Dublin. 
Every member of the public is affected by their surroundings regardless of location. EMC is currently number 4 in Ireland's great places to work. Fortune currently has had their number one spot filled by the same company for several years. I believe this is due to the atmosphere the employees are situated in. Their offices are renowned for their colour and general atmosphere. 

I think  implementing a similar approach to the workplace, such as painting offices in brighter colours ( blue, yellow, green, red)   would lead to EMC having a workforce of the future.


Not only would this implementation improve employee happiness, but more importantly  morale, efficiency and production. Similarly, this would help maintain a highly skilled workforce, while reducing employee overturn and therefore reducing long term capital losses.
