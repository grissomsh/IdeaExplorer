A Social platform-for Interaction, Collaboration and Creation 

Collection of random thoughts and experiences coming through mind.
There should be a forum where each employee of Global services should have an account with the profile updated with their skill sets and interests.

It should have different pages for different types of interactions (such as fun activities, cross-functional interactions and technical interactions) with all the employees having access to it. People with similar interests will be able to come up with some creation through these interactions across multiple geographies.

There should be some contests or quizzes held across entire GS on this site which will drive employees across multiples geographies to have some fun together. Prizes or appreciations should be given to the winners and participants to drive more people towards this.There can be options to upload the pictures of their BU specific activities on this forum to get to know each-other better.

There should be a search engine which can be used to search employee with some specific skill sets and hobbies. It can help to solve any issue faced or to fulfill any requirement across GS.

Any creative ideas or innovation can be shared on this forum for the purpose of knowledge sharing.

Employees across multiple geographies or BU can be involved in some CSR activities together. A larger group will be able to serve the society better as we can have more volunteers and fund to solve this purpose.
