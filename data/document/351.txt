Advancements or changes to Enterprise hybrid cloud
Our idea matches the Sponsor challenge as it discusses the improvements that should be made to EMC's enterprise hybrid cloud to have a competitive edge and to bridge gap with the competition
We came across this idea after comparing the needs of several enterprise application, database programs to the offerings available in private/public cloud. We found that there is a room for bringing in the machine learning capability, newer technology like dockers, and alternative hardware that can offload CPU workload in improving the EMC's hybrid cloud solution and make it more customer friendly.
  Our solution aims to  reduce the cloud offering cost for EMC by usage of

   - new hardware type
   - use of off the shelf components
   - Provide better reporting tool for the customer to monitor the health of hybrid cloud and cost saving
