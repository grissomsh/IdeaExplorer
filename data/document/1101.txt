Configuration template for different workloads, Ex, VDI, OLTP, etc
Provide simple solution to provision storage to target different workloads
The storage array, as a part of the IT infrastructure together with servers(virtualized or not), will be finally serving the applications
The traditional way to provision storage resources normally contains many steps. My idea is to leverage pre-defined typical workload template on array, then provision the resources to server and applications by just few simple clicks.
1, template for virtualized server workloads: scalable, high performance and low latency
2, template for VDI environments
3, template for ONTP workloads: high performance, replication and snapshots
4, template for Oracle & SAP NetWeaver solutions: dNFS, etc

Simplicity
Tight integration with application and solutions
