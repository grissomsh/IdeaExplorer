Better usage of our digital displays in the office
Enhanced use of our display screens would encourage a more contemporary cooler workplace. Depending on how far the solution can go, it could create a very modern and fun workplace with new and cutting edge ways to communicate and collaborate.

This idea was formed as part of an Idea Generation Session in Cork on 25th June.
Displaying relevant information to staff makes better use of the screens. Displaying a simple "Hello, Happy Friday" message would improve the staff morale in the office. 
If the screen is located near a swipe at a door, a personal message would provide a super cool user experience in the workplace. For example, if thee screen greeted the user directly (e.g. "Morning John") - it can tell who walked through the door from the badge swipe.
You could take this a step further and show a personalized dashboard to that specific user, e.g. show a view of their calendar for the morning / show their first meeting or show dashboard of SLAs on Apps they own, or simply a view of their team (e.g. Mary is on vacation today; Joe is celebrating 5 years at EMC today etc...) 
To increase the morale while also reaching a super UX in the office, a personal greeting and non-work related would be super cool.
