Rivet localization
drive cost out of our operations to enable investment in Platform 3

Rivets from existing supplier Emhart is expense and service is not as expected (do not support EMC RFQs and we have to buy through their distributors) which has been complained by SBMC team for a long time. Rivet localization would help solve ths issue.
As almost all of the rivets are being used in Asia specifically in China it would make sense to develop local sources in China which would bring not only cost savings but also better services wrt responses and deliveries etc.
Cost saving and service improvement.
