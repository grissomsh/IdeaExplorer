30 Day STEM Challenge

This idea originate from a GBS  Idea Generation Session.
Challenge Part 1: We often hear that if you do something for 30 days in a row and it will become a habit! With that in mind we challenge students to generate a fun and exciting 30-day challenge that encourages people to engage in STEM.  E.g. 30 days inside the cloud â€“ learn something new about the cloud every day and post online.
In teams or individually, students should generate a 30 day challenge and encourage friends, family and their local community to get involved. The students would be encouraged to takes pictures and record videos of the challenge participants throughout the 30 days. The goal would be to get participation and results trending on Facebook, twitter and other social mediums.  

Challenge Part 2: The students should submit a video combining the pictures and videos gathered throughout the challenge and a short video clip explaining how they generated the idea,  what they learned about STEM and how their impressions of STEM subjects has changed since taking on the challenge. 
The Challenge will be judged for;
1.The number of participants for the challenge
2.The level of attention generated online (number of followers, verified trends on twitter etc.)
3.The video that is submitted

The winners would receive a prize sponsored by EMC.
