Monitor as a Service for continuous system quality improvement
The expected "Monitor as a Service" should be one shared service for all EMC products as most of the monitor objects, hosts/arrays/and application should share similar performance metrics, as a shared shared service will provide best leverage and avoid du
I submit this idea to CCOE QA Council Paper Competition, it wins the silver award
The proposed Monitor-As-a-Service system is a SaaS service which stands on the shoulder of our Lab Cloud Service. It is composed of five components that are ‘Unified Management Interface’, ‘Event Monitor Module’, ‘Performance Report Module’, ‘Failure Analysis Module’ and ‘Customized Monitor Template’. ‘Unified Management Interface’ is a web based interface for user to login and configure the management objects, e.g. array, host, service etc. ‘Event Monitor Module’ is based on Nagios, it is responsible for actively monitoring the object and sending notification when exception or threshold meet. ‘Performance Report Module’ is based on Ganglia, it is one performance report module which will keep track of the performance data and generate performance data based on that.  ‘Failure Analysis Module’ is based on Splunk, it is used when failure happens and we want to identify the root cause of the failure. The ‘Customized Monitor Template’ is one collection of monitor scripts or plugins. Though Nagios has large amount of existing monitor plugin, there are still some monitor objects that are specific to our products, these special ones will be stored as ‘Customized Monitor Template’.


Once this solution is implemented, it will help us to leverage unified cloud platform to identify system problem/gap quickly, fix/catch critical architecture / performance issue in the 1st time, speed the product deliver and ensure our product's quality.
