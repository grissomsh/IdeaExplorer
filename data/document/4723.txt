IT Forum for EMC Employees

whenever I want to open the IT ticket, laptop is needed. Making requests through the mobile phone
create a mobile application that enables EMC Employees to open IT tickets and ask whatever questions through their mobile phones.

Employees will need to use their NT logins to be able to get connected to the application

EMC Employees  will have full time access to this IT portal. there will be many sections in this application where every discussion board addresses specific IT Topic

when Employees get connected to the application, they could navigate through the discussion boards to look for the topic they would like to ask about
