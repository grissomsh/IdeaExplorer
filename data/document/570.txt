Establish an education program for primary/junior schools where participating schools can achieve different levels of technology flags or badges as  measures of success for embedding technology & engineering as part of their curriculum. 
EMC's future in Ireland and globally is dependent on having large diverse pools of educated graduates. 
Increasing involvement and awareness of technology/engineering concepts within the school curriculum at a young age could help increase the numbers of students pursuing third level education in these spaces and in turn will give EMC broader talent pool for the future. 

Idea borne from a couple of observations 
1. I took part of in STEM discussion panel for 14 year old girls where it was apparent that not enough kids are considering technology as an attractive career option and that technology/engineering concepts are not part of core subjects studied in school. 
2. As a hiring manager I do not see enough diversity in the candidate pools applying for advertised engineering positions. 
3. As a mom, I was surprised to see that in Ireland at least the National Curriculum for Schools does not include a section on Technology. 
As a global tech leader we could play a part in establishing a national or international program that embeds technology/engineering concepts in junior cycle schools. This would encourage active participation by schools/teachers/pupils, government and large corporations in developing the talent pool of the future. 

Silver flags/badges for Schools could be a national or even international technology/engineering education programme that promotes and acknowledges long-term, whole school action in the Technology & Engineering space.
