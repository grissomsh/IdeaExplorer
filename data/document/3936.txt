Connection people across functions to deliver value for EMC.

Idea came to me while thinking about how to innovate and add value to EMC.
Innovation is needed to create and deliver value. Innovation comes through networking, asking questions, experimenting, and relating unrelated things. My idea is to organize “idea boot camps” bringing people from different functions in one place and creating small teams to brainstorm possibilities from a few things given on the table. These few things could be anything from a can of soft drink and a picture of bird to a mix of sales brochure and EMC products. Idea is to allow the small team to brainstorm and use their experiences to relate a few unrelated things and get inspirations from there to think about creating new products and solutions to deliver value for EMC. Ask them to think about the customer – a mobile user, a financial company, a manufacturing company etc. while brainstorming and see if they can open up new possibilities for these customer segments. Ask them what would they do if they become the CEO of their division or CEO of EMC. Challenge them to think beyond their usual tasks. Any business idea generated during the session should be considered and a decision of yes/not should be made with proper explanation from management. This would build trust and confidence in employees as they would see the commitment from management.
