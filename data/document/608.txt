Enhancement in the Work From Home policy
This idea is to focus on the problems and challenges we have with regards to the regular shift works inside the ICOE premises. 
This is my own idea. I realized that this will benefit to share.
Enhancing the work from home policy and providing more flexibility to the employees will overcome these challenges as explained above. 
It will definitely save money for the company as the company will not have to pay huge amount to the transport vendors. :-) Instead, company can offer more work from home options and reimbursement for the internet connection. That can be beneficial for both the company and employees.
