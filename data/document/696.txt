Professional Service Collaboration Process/Portal
My submissoin directly matches the Sponson challanges by proposing an end-to-end process change with customer value and business relevance. This new proces being proposed addresses the need for a clearer policy, greater accountability and efficiency with increased communications and collaboration.

This ideas has been something I have been thinking about everytime we quote professional services and work with the PS teams on execution.  I have been provided feedback from my customers about the lack of insight and communications regarding project schedules and deliverables. 
Redefine the process to lean out wasted time and have a clear value added portal.  This process would involve an end-to-end Pre-Sales Professional Services (PS) definition to final completion of these services.  This would include a well-defined process and portal that all Pre-Sales, Sales, PS teams, customers, and related EMC business people would have access to for insight.  This customer focused PS Portal would create a highly sought after new experience for our customers!

This would include the following:
Web-based portal to see project (PS) scope and schedule 
Areas for posting documentation TO/From customer (history and tracking)
Customer Feedback 
Metrics on Schedule
FAQs, Links to EMC docs, etc

If my idea for this process improvement was fully implemented it would drive customer satisfaction with regards to Professional services.  It would drive increased EMC internal collaboration and increase revenue in this area.  It would help with metrics related to PS schedules and input from customers on how well we are doing.
