EMC Theatre

At my university there were always a play which we loved watching it and it was so good. I would also like to act in real life but still didn't get the chance to do so.
There will be a place to perform plays and talents. And there will be a yearly play where the employees can join in acting. Then they could sell tickets for the play and friends and family could come and watch this play. If the play is good we can enter national competitiones with it We could also gain money from that that we can use it for the next play and so on.
