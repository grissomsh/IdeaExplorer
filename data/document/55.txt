Key strokes KPI
modernizing the internal systems
ease of access for everyone
better internal user experience, more efficient
I see all employes doing repeat steps to open their systems in beginning of the day, users try to utilize macros due to repetitive clicks that they have to make
Save time for employees, drive efficiency in daily tasks by: 

-Introducing a KPI: # of keyboard strokes/clicks required to perform actions in internal systems.
- All enhancements to system's frontends should prove reduction of keystrokes required by end users to perform action
-Drive and prioritize all system changes and WRs based on efficiency/reduction to keystrokes required
- Key strokes analysis for existing systems one by one based on usage widespread

examples: 
- programming keyboard to have a 1 button for locking PC saves 1 click for 70,000 employees at least 3 times a day, those seconds aggregate to days, which is money in salaries
- simplifying logging in to systems, default for fields or giving up mandatory fields that aren't put into use could save seconds per user repetitively for every single employee
EMC users will gain minutes per day x 70000 employee x 365 days, aggregating to millions of dollars in repetitive steps due to systems design
