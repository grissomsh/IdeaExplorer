XtremIO as part of BC in a VMAX3
Innovative way to sell XtremIO "New Use Case"
This came from a customer that was already doing VPLEX Metro with VMAX 10K and while we were planning out refresh of the highly virtualized environment we ran a data reduction assessment and saw and expected 5:1 data reduction to which the customer quickly got onboard with the XtremIO add to the environment as he was buying less storage and it was all flash. His concerns about data reduction where minimized through assessment and the fact that he still had another year on his VMAX. Customer is still now thinking about have ing a VMAX or VNX for the second tier as he feels it is necessary and would prefer it all in one box and one management console (Customer just purchased ViPR with the Bricks as well).
VMAX3 loaded up with 1.2TB 10k drives, with SLO & FAST X - the FAST X tier is all XtremIO and we also leverage SRDF Metro for the Active-Active. We know have a ton of memory between the VMAX and XtremIO, we now have a BOATLOAD of Front End ports (which some customers really like), we also now have a 2nd tier with the 10k drives in the event the workload profile really dictates it going elsewhere then a flash tier (most customers will tell you not everything needs flash) and we leverage everything under VMAX management controls - Single Pane of Glass.
VPLEX hardware refresh is coming in 2016, this is ideal for customers that run multi-vendor stratgy and mid-tier (VNX), but for enterprise predominatly EMC customers they like the idea of managing behind a VMAX, providing SLO, FAST X & SRDF Metro all work
