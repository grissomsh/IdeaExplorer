Exchanging experience around the world.
This solution fits the diversity challenge by exploring diverse cultures and mindsets in different locations
For me I have never traveled abroad and one of my wishing list is to travel abroad to live a new adventure and explore different cultures. 
My idea is simple.Every employee can do his/her same job for a month in another country.
For example,a TSE from Egypt can travel and works as a TSE in Ireland or India for a month.
By this simple solution:
1-The employee will explore different cultures within EMC.
2-The employee may transfer to his workplace in his/her country some useful things he/she has witnessed abroad.
3-This experience will bring motivation to Employees.
