 EMC's craigslist-- Mobile App/Website 
Community Involvement Challenge: This app will provide a marketplace for the EMC community on all mobile platforms 
HR Challenge - Diversity and Innovation at a Great Place to Work: This app will provide a marketplace for the EMC community on all mobile platforms
This idea came up because a few years back EMC used to have a website for personal classifieds and we have used the site to buy pets, furniture, rent apartments,etc. When craiglist became popular this was shut down. The safety to interact within EMC community was lost.  
This app will provide a marketplace for the EMC community. This will be a place where employees can post their personal classifieds.
Will foster interaction between emc employees. Contributes to making EMC a great place to work.
