Connecting cars over the internet
As IOT blows every aspect of our lives, connecting our cars over the internet gives us the privilege to check everything related to where I parked my car,
A mobile application getting you these info about your car would be an add on.
And relevance to the challenges is that it invades a whole new market for EMC, which is the Car industry market.
Apple find my iphone application, an idea like that but for cars.
A new product like software that can be injected within the car software, if you run it, it gives you clear picture of where your car is right now, and so many statistics about your car such as the gas level, maintenance if needed and so on..
We can sell this idea to different car trade marks or could be exclusively to specific trademark, having such a utility in my car is needed nowadays, also if implemented, we -EMC- are invading the Car market, and hence a whole new financial source.
