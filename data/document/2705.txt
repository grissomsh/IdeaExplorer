Shuttle Bus between Ireland COE Campus'
The Ireland COE would like to encourage communication & collaboration between employees. An employee shuttle bus between all three Ireland campus' on an hourly/ bi-hourly schedule would encourage people to travel to other campus' for face-to-face meetings
This idea was born out of frustration with trying to find parking in City Gate!  I am based in Ovens and frequently have meetings in City Gate.  I find that like many others, the only time I can conveniently meet people in other campus' is first thing in the morning or last thing in the evening . A shuttle bus service would make it easier to travel between campus' throughout the working day.
I propose an employee shuttle bus to run hourly or bi-hourly between Ovens, Ballincollig and City Gate on a set timetable.  At the moment employees use their own vehicles to travel between the campus', which means there is a cost to the employee.  Hopkinton use a system of minivans to travel between the five disparate campus' (42, 80, 176, 228 and 171).  This works on a demand basis with approximately 6 minibuses moving on demand between all the sites.  For the Ireland COE I would propose a timetable shuttle bus, where, for instance, at the top of the hour a bus leaves Ovens via Ballincollig bound for City Gate; and at the bottom of the hour the bus leaves City Gate bound for Ovens.  Demand would determine the final schedule and number of vehicles required for the scheme.
This service would encourage communication, by increasing the ability for people to have face-to-face meetings.  It would have environmental impact of reducing carbon emissions.  It would improve employee satisfaction by saving money for the employee.
