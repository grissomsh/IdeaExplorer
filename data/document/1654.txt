EMC Servers for home professional users and Small Businesses
in the near future not only huge companies will need servers but also home users and small companies,
Producing EMC Servers for home professional users and very Small Businesses will expose EMC to a New Market and will be an excellent instrument to differentiate EMC from its competitors.
This will allow EMC to spread it's Brand Name across different kind of customers.
The idea came from VMware, all my friends knows VMware very well because they use free products like VMware player, but when we talk about EMC they fairly know any product for EMC,where there is no single product that target them from EMC, which is affordable and simple to use
What if EMC Starts to target home professional users and small business (start ups) who just need servers for there projects.

what if EMC Starts to sell a product that is inspired by "VSPEX BLUE" ease of use with a very simple interface to those users


First: Expose EMC to a New Market
Second: EMC brand name and product quality will spread across more and more users (millions of users)

Third: EMC won't have to depend on huge customers in there revolutionary big decisions 

Fourth: EMC Can reuse there old stock products in making products targeting small entities
