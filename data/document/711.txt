Savings on Third Party spent - C&C NA
We have RMC as third party collection agency to help us collect on aged invoices. Through project Balboa we have controlled the amount spent by $2MM for year 2014-2015. There are transactions moving to them which can be avoided to save the spent. Most of these transactions are being written off than collected
C&C NA takes hit on these AR that are moved to RMC every quarter upto 3MM on 60+ AR
ISSC collection team is capable of handling these transactions by regular collection activities. We could also track the collection trail in our applications than to have no insight on how RMC is collecting them
we currently have $2M budget as third party spent and we can save it too
