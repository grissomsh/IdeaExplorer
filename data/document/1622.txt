IOT security 
the IOT is an emerging technology that came to our life most recently, its security is something important that need to be considered.
.
1. Secure booting: When power is first introduced to the device,
the authenticity and integrity of the software on the device is
verified using cryptographically generated digital signatures.
In much the same way that a person signs a check or a legal
document, a digital signature attached to the software image
and verified by the device ensures that only the software that
has been authorized to run on that device, and signed by the
entity that authorized it, will be loaded. 
2. Access control: Next, different forms of resource and access
control are applied. Mandatory or role-based access controls
built into the operating system limit the privileges of device
components and applications so they access only the resources
they need to do their jobs. If any component is compromised,
access control ensures that the intruder has as minimal access
to other parts of the system as possible
improving the IOT security will help us to use the technology in more safer way.
