CM Consolidation within 12 month time frame for P2 platforms for BTO
At present EMC has multiple CMs producing piece parts, sub assemblies and finished assemblies for P2 platforms. This requires many resources that could potentially be focusing on P2.5 & P3. By moving all existing P2 work to one or two CM(s) it will free up resources to work exclusively on P2.5/P3.
Recently we have been tasked to make the business more flexible and efficient. Trying to continue with as is P2 supply chains as well as develop P2.5/P3 processes it a massive undertaking for existing resources. Freeing up resources by consolidation P2 BTO business to 1 or 2 CMs appears to be the logical thing to do.
By assigning a time frame to consolidate it will ensure all team(s)/stakeholders are making decisions to meet the agreed time frame. A number of years ago a lot of time was spent discussing if V-Max would/could/should be built in China. There were a number of quarters devoted to discussions if it would or would not happen. All this stopped when Tucci sent out a memo telling the teams he want a V-Max to ship from China by a particular date. This memo ensure the teams were focusing on the execution of the strategy rather than debating the strategy.
Success would be the identification of the 1 or 2 CM(s) by end of Q3 2015 and full transfer from current state to future state by end of Q3 2016 with no negative impact to current QCATS.
Identification of resources to maintain P2 and those to work solely on P2.5/P3 by end of Q3 2105. Over time as P2 demand drops resources can transition over to P3 teams.
