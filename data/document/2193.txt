COE Innovation Competition
The idea encourages employees in different Business Unites to participate in a competition within each COE to submit ideas in various fields according to the diversity within every Business unite. EMC COE consists of different BUs technically and non technical. Also, within each BU there are so many people with different talents and skills. So this competition will engage many people of different backgrounds that will encourage diversity. 
I came up with this idea because there is always a challenge to submit innovation ideas during the busy day at work. So the competition with a decent reward at the end is always a good drive to achieve better performance.
A competition that will include all employees in the COE. Since there are different departments in each COE. for Example Customer support, Project management, HR .. Each director for each department is responsible for the employees that he/she is leading. Applying the competition for example on the customer support department, this department contains different Business unites ( products, teams). The competition will be among these teams. the scoring will be based on the participation rate ( no. of employees submitted ideas/total employees) and Ideas per employees in each team. Then the BU average rate ( (Participation Rate+# Ideas/employee)/2) will be calculated. Each team then will be ranked accordingly and the team with the highest ranking will receive a decent reward.
I will call my idea success if it encouraged a high rate of participants and ideas, higher than the number of idea submitter each year in each COE. This idea will benefit the company in terms of high ideas productivity and submission and will assist in solving the challenge with the innovation process. Also this will encourage most of the employees in all departments. So a higher participation number is ensured.
