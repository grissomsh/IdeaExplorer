health-check tool for qualification projects test bed

We do face problems on using share environments, conflicts cannot be avoided. 
The first time when you have set up your qualification project. Define and enter the key check points into the tool, and define in the configuration files on which host/switch/array to connected to and what command should be given to verify the environment is not touched by other people.
Next time when you are going to start the work of a day, just one button click on the tool, it will tell you if your test bed setup is in a green status.
