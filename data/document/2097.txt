Docker is an open-source project that automates the deployment of applications inside software containers, by providing an additional layer of abstraction and automation of operating-system-level virtualization on Linux. Docker uses resource isolation features of the Linux kernel such as cgroups and kernel namespaces to allow independent "containers" to run within a single Linux instance, avoiding the overhead of starting and maintaining virtual machines

By Dockerizing the EMC apps, the amount of energy required to run the server reduces. All the apps runs on the docker container, hence saves the power.

Docker advantages:
a) Containers can be created almost instantly – as quickly as spawning a new Linux process. This is excellent in scenarios where many transient, temporary instances need to be created and eliminated.
b) Containers are “lightweight”, sharing the same kernel and libraries and taking very little additional memory and disk space.

Saves power energy to the organization and hence save in dollars
