OS Based Manufacturing Final Configuration Testing

The idea is part of a manufacturing OE initiative that is being worked on by:
Apex TED: Bill Leonard, Todd Grenier
EMSD: Greg Bertoni, Phil Leef, Andrew Kensmoe,Roko Peros 

The VNX test process consists of diagnostic test section and an OS load/test section.  The total test time can be reduced by incorporating the diagnostic testing into the OS section of the test process.  A test time saving of 30-50% could be realized.
