Enhance employee benefits.
Have worked in EMC 3 years.
Some colleagues has left EMC. Provide better benefits, reduce staff leaving rate, could build a really great place to work.
From a ex-colleagues who works in Alibaba now.
Help employee from different aspects, create more methods to reduce the affection from family.
e.g.
1. Some employee could not buy the house in the work place. Company could provide interest-free loan to employee.
2. More and more employee are parents, kindergarten and primary school has become a very basic problem now. If company could give some help on these aspects. It could give employee strong sense of belonging.

Above are some examples, I also know it's hard to be executed. However, the employee are sentient. If company could give help from the small, the employee feel company and employee are a community. Employee will be initiative.
Create a better palce to work.
