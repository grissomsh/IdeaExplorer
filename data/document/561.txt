Minimize the steps in Exchange & Vmware Client Integration with Avamar

This is something product team needs to be think on this & do some innovation in Avamar & VMWARE integration & Exchange. There are some additional steps we have to perform while implementing VMWare solution in Avamar. Whereas in Symantec NetBackup & Backup Exec there are less steps to be performed. 

During the POC this would be very hard to convince about this steps & also this will be win-win situation for our competitor products. Minimum Configuration steps would save the critical administration & Implementation task for the customer, so Sales will be helped during the POC & in terms of proposing the effective Product solution in the customer environment.
