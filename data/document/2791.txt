IOT device identification by device profiling
Internet of things, identification and enhanceing security by profiling the devices
In one of the initiative by RSA Bangalore team about this yearâ€™s Innovation Roadmap, IOT was discussed along with the problems associated with it. After that in one of the brainstorming session about internet of things, we came up with the idea.
The important part of internet of things is to identify the devices. So in the process of identifying the device a profile should be assigned to a particular device with the specific task that the device is supposed to perform and the profiling of the device will help in identifying the compromise of the device. So as part of profiling, gathering of the information like when it has communicated with other devices and what type of data transfer has happened can be gathered in a centralize location which has the profile for that particular device. In case of mismatch between the profile and the data gathered as part of the profiling of the device, the device will be in suspicious state and need to take action as per the policies.
This will be about identifying the device and pro-actively identifying the device that are compromised.
