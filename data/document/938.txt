Thing Appliance and IOT Things Network
Smart city needs IOT platform to handle  water , energy , security etc. Limited availability of integrated solution for the IoT that makes development and deployment for  IoT based product & services feasible.
Backing up volume of data generated by IoT will present potentially insoluble governance issues, such as network bandwidth and remote storage bandwidth, and capacity to back up all raw data is likely to be unaffordable. Consequently, organizations will have to automate selective backup of the data that they believe will be valuable/required. This sifting and sorting will generate additional big data processing issues.

Idea came up while working on some demand and market studies around on IOT.
