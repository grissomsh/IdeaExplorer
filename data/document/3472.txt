- Enhance Opening Service Request Process.

- Idea came up to save the time of TSE and Customer in Hot Cases that has DU/DL Situations
- When the customer opens any Service Request. He can just choose an option to send CODE RED email when he face DU/DL Situation.

- If he selected this option. Email will be sent Automatically to the CODE RED Approval Team with some information about the issue and box.

- When TSE will start to handle the issue. He will not need to send the CODE RED Email as it is already sent by the customer.

- TSE can just send an updates.
