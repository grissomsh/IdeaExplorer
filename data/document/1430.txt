Adding an option in the service center to allow the SR to send a notification email to any TSE whenever an update is made in the SR.
It will be a time saver, as instead I check all my SRs at the beginning of the day, I only check the SRs that got updated by a coach or the customer.
I had a case where I put the NCC 3 days after and the customer already updated the case at the same day but after I set the NCC.
So I got back to him but thought that it would be a lot easier if there is a notification sent to my email.
We can add an option in the service center to give the TSE the choice to be sent an email whenever any change happens in the SR.
Even when another TSE wants to monitor the SR he can have this option also.

This will enhance productivity through time saving, leading to better customer care and overall customer experience.
