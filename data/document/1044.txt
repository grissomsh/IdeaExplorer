Networker client includes binary for filesystem and modules
Different binaries(NMM,NMDA) for different applications along client(NWclient) agent binary

I came up with the Idea after i saw customers getting confused with different Networker binaries
Developing a single Networker client Agent  , that contains dllâ€™s for different modules in one binary.

Would make less confusion to customer and EMC resources, no need to download and install multiple binaries.It will improve customer satisfaction
