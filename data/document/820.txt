Enrollment
•	User records a short clip (e.g. 4 seconds), or if no microphone is available, 
        selects a sound from a large set of “stock” prerecorded sounds
Login
•	User enters username and clicks next
•	Secure website displays an icon to allow the user to play their enrolled sound
•	User recognizes sound, trusts site as genuine, and proceeds with entering and
        submitting password

o	This is particularly useful for IoT (including smartwatches) because playing a
        sound is easier than other text, images or other forms of verifications on a 
        small screen.
o	Similar in purpose to Site-to-User Voice
o	Another company owns the Intellectual Property of a similar method that uses 
        Images instead of Audio.
