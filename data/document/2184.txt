Zigbee Smart City
Zigbee Smart city idea encourages the concept of internet connected sensors geographically distribution across different locations. Since Egypt COE smart City and IOT challenge are keen on reinventing data storage, archiving, backup and recovery, networking and Data Analytic to handle a smart city, then this idea is the perfect solution that meets this challenge
The idea was based on a thorough study during my senior year in university and the idea was applied in Cairo for monitoring water level, temperature and humidity.The idea was implemented by a group of 5 students in Electronics engineering at American university in Cairo. The idea was then used be engineers in Orange research and development department. However, the idea can be simply implemented by zigbee modules
This idea can be used for many projects like free parking slots monitoring, transportation monitoring, and Fire alarm and pets schedule monitoring. The idea can be customized for any data storage and analysis. The idea is based on the concept of Zigbee module. Zigbee is used to set a wireless sensor network by collecting data from different nodes located in different geographical places. The data that is monitored and collected from different sensor nodes can be stored in a storage servers and backed up also can be instantly sent over network for instant monitoring. 
It will be about wireless sensors that are connected together and send the data to a database over the network. These sensors are not costy and are affordable. Also the programing of such chips are very simple using C++
