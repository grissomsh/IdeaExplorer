Innovation through incentives 
I think my idea matches the challenge addressed as it looks at collaboration among employees to gain diverse thinking with an overall view to creating innovated ideas. 
I came up with this idea when I thought about what would motivate employees to diversify their thinking and help EMC innovate. 
I propose a system where employees are encouraged to collaborate with the use of incentives. For each project an employee works on outside their department/ team they gain credits. These credits add up to be retrieved at certain times of the year. The more projects and the more people the employee works with the higher the rewards. As collaboration is key to innovate ideas I think this would be a good solution. Additionally, the more people that will be in each teams the more diverse the thinking will be as people will be of different ages/backgrounds and education and this will help create innovate EMC for the future.  
I hope this idea will add great benefits to EMC. By employees working with others and gain incentives they will be happier in their jobs and retain employee engagement and less turnover. Additionally, it will provide EMC with new ideas and thought process that will help them in creating the workplace of the future.
