Themed Months 
This will work on the diversity and inclusion challenge. 
this year, there was no decorations and a different spirit
When ever there is a special occasion in a month, we can decorate the office from outside and inside according to it.  For example: New Years, Ramadan..etc. and have a dish party to celebrate. 
creative working environment
