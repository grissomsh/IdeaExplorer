Why stop Innovating from June 21st on-wards ?

No great ideas & inventions happens based on time lines. Innovation can happen any time of the day & any time during the year. You know this better :-) By limiting it to a deadline, we are killing that one idea that might just be the next big thing. 
If an employee has a brilliant idea on 21st June of later this year... & he moves on to another company.. a rival company.. & implements the same there.. we loose the opportunity. I know, that's a hypothetical situation; still we all know the stories of companies who failed to act while others seized the opportunities.
Keep the innovation Challenge open for the whole year. Take stock of ideas before our EMC world event; Let EMC world be the yearly cycle. Celebrate the innovators at EMC world perhaps? & continue with new challenges & this forum open throughout the year.
