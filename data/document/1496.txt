Software-defined NVRAM
It matches with APJ COE "Solutions Platform" Challenge. This idea is a Cost Efficiency solution, which can give EMC better profits for storage platform design, with lower cost.  

When investigate Intel NVDIMM, I realized that it could be a good replacement for NVRAM.

My new idea is based on NVDIMM, but it extend the NVDIMM capabilities by following two key points,

a. Using read/write load balance algorithm to address NVDIMM endurance problem.
b. Add a virtualization layer to let software define the NVRAM device
There are two parts in this new solution.

1. A hardware management layer to provide persistent data store

Next generation Intel NVDIMM can be used for the data store.
NVDIMM has following advantages than other solutions,

a. Very low latency. The latency is higher than DRAM but lower than SSD.

b. Will be available on commodity x86 platforms, which is much cheaper than NVRAM card

The disadvantage is, NVDIMM has the endurance problem.  
However, we can use 2 or 3 times capacity to gain very good endurance if we use software to read/write balance for NVDIMM IO. 

2. A NVRAM emulation layer to provide generic NVRAM interface to storage stack.

Because we add a software emulation layer between NVRAM user and NVDIMM hardware, we actually gain follow benefits from this level virtualization,

a. On the fly capacity provisioning 

b. NVRAM provisioning could be integrated with any existing software defined storage solution.

c. Possibility to add extra erasure code solution for NVRAM itself data protection

All these features could be provided by traditional NVRAM.
Meeting with one of following conditions could be considered as success,

a. Lower storage box manufacture cost
b. Better DDVE performance
c. Integration with software defined storage solution to increase the deployment and support efficiency
