XtremIO gone Mobile 
This idea will enhance our customer's user experience. 
I have often thought about this because of the apps so many other companies have created. Specifically, VMware and being able to have a lite manager from your phone. I am an active person that doesn't like to be tied to a computer 100% of my day. It allows freedom to have a life. 
A quick dashboard in your pocket and view your device status to make better choices on the fly. This argument can be made for any other app that has gone mobile. 
I would like to see customers and storage engineers feel less tied to a computer to monitor the array. We would be helping the quality of life of our customers with easy access and have 1 less thing to worry about.
