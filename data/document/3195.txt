VPlex as software agnostic to hardware or OS failure

During discussion on VPlex
Idea is to make VPlex as an application agnostic to hardware or OS failure by moving/migrating VPlex application to the existing directors in the cluster in case of hardware or OS failure without impacting the host IOs using virtual ports.
