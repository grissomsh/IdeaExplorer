Brainstormer - using crowdsourcing for brainstorming
Brainstormer is a platform for a crowd source ideas generation and collection on various challenges/threads in parallel.
As a members in data science team we required to be innovative in our day-to-day live so our team came to the conclusion that such system can help us deliver more ideas on various topics on everyday basis. 
Now it is in an internal and initial development stage with an existing prototype.

Brainstormer is a platform which has the following features:
1) engage employees to share their thoughts. 
2) encourage employees to be creative and to generate new/more ideas. 
3) a platform for employees (the crowd) to share the thoughts. (And receive some feedback for further motivation).
4) a crowd voting for a “wining ideas”
5) idea live-cycle management for the administrator
Such tool will increase the number of employees willing to participate and will allow to increase the number of ideas relevant to a specific challenge. Moreover we believe that enabling voting and comments will generate even more valuable ideas.
In addition, Brainstormer can enable global collaboration by allowing each local team to work on its timezone and mother tongue (while  the server will make the necessary analytics to normalize the information).
The true value to a company can be evaluated based on the quality of ideas (which were implemented afterwards).
