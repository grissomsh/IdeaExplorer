App Analytics on EMC Solutions.
Today we dont have concrete data/analytics on how our EMC applications are consumed by the customer. EMC should have AppAnalytics server which can get such data from the customer to understand the customer behavior and use cases. All the software solutions should collect such stats and the centralized server should analyze the data to improve the products. such analytics can help how often our application is used, what version of OS and our products are using, what features are using, find and crash logs, understand user behavior , region/locale of the application running etc.
The idea is in early stage and not implemented. i have asked some of the team members like which features of your new product is used by customers mostly? and all the customers are updated to new version? for such questions they dont have data. So this idea popped up.
The existing and new EMC  solutions will be modified to send such stats and anonymous (with the user consent) to EMC centralized server. The centralized server will have the Extraction of those data and do all the analytics. based on that stats the future release can focus on the customer need.   
The real success of this implementation is DIRECT customer satisfaction. Understanding customer behavior and solving their problem is real need of any product. Also this solution will increase the penetration of the application in the fields since we are adding more features/focus on customer need in the road map.
