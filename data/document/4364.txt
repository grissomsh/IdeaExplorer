Fundraising through Payroll Giving

France HR has been involved in Wellbeing programs for long and has been discussing this project for several months. With EMC encouraging employees to give back, we think this is the right moment to launch the project. It would be a good example of a Great Place to Work  with dual participation, the employees and the company. Payroll Giving is simple to operate and it can help to build good relations with your employees and incresae their motivation. Charities benefit because they get regular donations to help them with good causes. As part of a broader corporate social responsibility policy, Payroll Giving offers employees the opportunity to channel their support for their social concerns whilst at the same time demonstrating the company’s credentials as a socially responsible business. It is easy to donate a fex cents or euro per month. Small amounts build big rivers.
Payroll Giving is a simple way for the employees to make regular and one-off payments to charity directly from their pay. Employees’ donations have been deducted by EMC through MicroDon and ADP from the payroll. EMC donate and distribute timely and efficiently to the relevant fundraising organisations. It's up to the participating employees to choose which charities they want to support. The administrative costs supported by EMC should be very low. Once you've set up your payroll system for Payroll Giving you should find that it just becomes part of your routine payroll procedure. Any extra costs can be set against your profits for tax purposes. Microdon will provide the legal, fiscal and technical assistance.
