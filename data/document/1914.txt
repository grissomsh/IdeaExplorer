Global Business Services(GBS) process re-engineering and automation using Software Robotics
Our idea was to automate existing business processes with simple scripts in very short time(2-3 weeks). This perfectly aligns with the E2E Horizon – End to End Business Process Challenge. The idea is simple to implement and will get huge savings in cost
Software Robotics was suggested as one of the ways for addressing a GBS problem. Selenium was chosen the tool from our past experience in automation.
The proposed solution which is currently in UAT is built using Software robotics approach.
All data sources associated with the manual process are identified and configured.
Using data sources from step1, simple open source robotic framework ( Selenium in this case), each step in the process is defined configured and coded. Please note: These steps are nothing but web crawling and screen scrapping processes. 

A demo of screen scrapping can be seen here

A reusable auditing and exception framework is used to provide  to capture the information related to process execution flow.
END 2END process automation is triggered using a simple web app that runs all the steps configured in point:2 above.
Example USE CASE ( in testing phase): Email Notification

Process automation can be achieved in 2-3 weeks
Basic Java programming skills is sufficient
Normal PC like machines would be sufficient to execute robots
Easy to change the robot code
Very high RoI(Return of Investment) thanks to huge savings achieved in very short time
