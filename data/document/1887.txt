Federation Newsletter - Ireland
You challenged us to find a way to bring the federation closer together.
We already have the Coffee Communications and the GMO Pulse Newsletter in EMC II, these have prooven to be a successful tool to all employees so why not take this one step further.
Create a EMC Federation Ireland Newsletter, By reaching out to all the sites around Ireland and looking for representives from each company coming together monthly or quaterly via teleconference to design and implement a cross federation email newsletter with information from each of the sites being shared with everyone. 
If implemented a Federation newsletter would be developed and sent to ALL Ireland federation employees on a periodic basis, bringing news from each company and site. It will help foster a closer knit community and could drive collaboration.
