Global material sharing solution based on REST API and port forwarding
Global Product Operations Challenge: This idea meets GPOâ€™s challenge by making the design process more efficient and effective, driving cost out of our operations to enable investment in Platform 3 and advancing the performance of our design process. 
FFV handles projects on a global, 24x7 basis. Material availability in the Shanghai COE labs due to cost, logistics and schedule are frequently an area of concern. A central sharing approach was required in order to introduce efficiency and alleviate the additional burden of infrastructure maintenance such as license procurement and physical relocation of DUTs. 
The solution consists of two components: Port Forwarding Agent and Web UI.

The Agent consists of a Python application script running on a Windows or Linux host. It controls user access to DUT material registered in its local database via a technique known as Port Forwarding. Included within the physical testing infrastructure is a console management server that supports the port forwarding feature. All physical DUT serial ports are connected to the console management server. Using port forwarding, the agent builds a logical interface between the DUT and the requestor. The agent maintains control over the interface and can enforce policy such as DUT reservation time.

The Web UI services all requestor access. Web administration can spawn and tear down multiple agents via a RESTful API. The API also provides a backend for test management and automation component integration.	
This idea will save much time and money from global material manufacturing and delivery which happen in each design phase and are always costly and time-consuming. Also it will advance the efficiency of our material which will in turn promote our design p
