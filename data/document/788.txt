The idea will help the employees during their working day. 
There are employees who work 12 hours a shift. 
Also employees who are stuck for hours in a customer environment can easily go and get something fresh. 
Employees would benefit from the idea. 
It will be easier to get some food, instead of going to the cafeteria and having to wait there if it's crowded.
