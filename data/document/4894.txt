Let's be locked out of poverty.

I thought about the idea when I noticed that we retire around 100 Laptop/desktop every year, and we can use them in an effective way to spread the knowledge and enable EMC to known among the young students and make its technology inspired by them
EMC can offer Computer labs for the primary and secondary schools in the underdeveloped countries where we are operating or selling our products as a community involvement initiative. 

We can establish these labs easily with our old desktops/laptops. We can start teaching some customized courses for the students such as modern science with interactive videos. Technology basics with concentration on how EMC realize it in the real world.
