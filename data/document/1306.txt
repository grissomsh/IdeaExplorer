EMC's new market 
My idea is relevant to the challenge as it helps combat the issue of communication. EMC should be interested in this market as their is a great deal of employees working in some teams/ department and often one point of contact to deliver information is best.  
I came up with this idea as there was a number of misunderstanding over meeting locations and times. 
My idea is to have electronic noticeboards in each department. Theses noticeboards will display information relevant to each department such as details of team outing, problems with printers and contain meeting timetables and room bookings. 
I think that this idea will add a great deal of benefits to employees and managers and it will help communication between departments. It will also limit the need for using other meeting resources such as outlook as all information will be clearly visible to the relevant employees.
