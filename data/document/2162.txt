Out of Office for Engineers as well as for customer's to be updated automatically in the SR.
Its very difficult to get information on customer's availability , which hits the TTR of the SR also it becomes difficult to track customer via email/call. For which we also keep sending multiple emails and at the end we close the SR with 3 strike .  
As updated on the Problem summary we can have this idea implemented on the SR creating tool.
My solution here is that we can at least have a field to update automatically where in customer/engineer can update there status on the SR so that we can be on the same page and process accordingly.
Time saving for customer as well as engineers.
Backlog will be reduced.
Clear communication and expectation will be set .
