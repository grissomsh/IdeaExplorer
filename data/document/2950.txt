One Stop destination to learn about products in an organization
Organization do  not have single destination to locate/learn/share information about product. Collaboration among stakeholders like Customers, Engineering, Sales, pre-sales, customer support, product management is a challenge.
Work experience
Proposed idea is to build an application portal which would integrate all available tools in an organization like, JIRA, wiki, Inside EMC, eRoom,knowledge base,customer feedback blogs etc. Also have a blog spot to relevant parties for vote, comment and propose ideas which helps in betterment of the product. Have search facility to spot any topic for: education purpose,helps in building/testing of products. Search by:products, issues (JIRA integration), component tags, test data (wiki, Inside EMC). Cool dashboard to show top 10 issue areas for any product faced by customers.
Share information to build better product, teams can advertise on cool things they build(eg:one click installation of the product test bed), improving quality, understand product usage in real-world,"HAPPY CUSTOMERS", ultimately better sales and revenue.
