GUI (screen) screenshots for customer problems
Improve TCE, improve service quality
The idea was suggested in the course of brainstorming for Captiva.  I asked guys if I may transfer this idea to VNX/XTremIO
Have single button in GUI to get screenshot(s) and to send screenshot(s) to EMC support
Implementation of idea would improve customer satisfaction, and optimize process of AR analysis and resolution
