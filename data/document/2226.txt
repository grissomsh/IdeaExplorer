refuse to remove user lun from filestorage group if a mapping file pool is in use state
for better user experience in using VNX product.
challenge for "CTD Supportability in 12 Months or Less"
We usually have to manually reset the NAS DB and delete all related File System and check point and nas volums at file side if someone directly remove a user LUN from filestorage group without checking its NAS objects.
It's hard to return to previous stable state even we take much time to do some cleaning up operations. 
The operation should be refused and will show an error message like 'the LUN has a file pool and file system or checkpoint,it will not be allowed to remove directly.'
Ensure VNX product's stability and correctnes and improve user's experience.
