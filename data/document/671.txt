Office DÃ©cor of the future
This idea helps define and shape the office environment for the future.
Idea came up during a brainstorming session
The solution is 3 fold:
1. Paint / paper murials on office walls in EMC branded blue color depicting the major cities we currently ship a lot of product too. Each office are could then be described by the city in question (eg new York... Singapore et etc) instead of dreary block J, H I etc etc.
2. Deploy subtle storage solutions that allow the office areas to be less cluttered and have a minimalist effect. 
3. Put real (not plastic) plants in office areas to add an outdoor feel and also to demonstrate our commitment to sustainability.
Modern minimalist office space with loads of hidden storage area and bright images on the wall depicting the cities / regions we sell to. Loads of real plants to brighten the place up too.
