Product Information Database
A product information database would off clarity to all parties inside GPO on where each piece of hardware fits into the various platforms that EMC offers. As EMC moves from Platform 2 to 2.5 and eventually to 3, the potential hardware combinations to make a platform will be significant and can lead to significant confusion during the different phases of bringing a product to market. A product information database that can be used internally will help in aligning everyone working on individual pieces of hardware to the big picture.
Working in the power commodity there has been a variety of power supplies developed that can be used in a variety of systems.This has lead to a handful of part numbers for the same power supply. We created a database using Microsoft Access to help and provide all relevant about a power supply after searching for a part number, or power supply name.
By having a searchable database, a user of the database could simply search a keyword about the hardware there are interested in. It may be the name of the product a P/N or general description of it. The database would then pull all information that matches this keyword. The information could include functional specifications for the hardware, design engineer contact, supply chain engineer contact, as well as a breakdown of where this piece of hardware can be used. This method would be much better then going through all the various channels of SAP because all relevant information would be stored in this one place.
If this project would be successful, we would see a searchable database that an EMC employee could use searching a keyword about the hardware in question. When the search results come up on the product all documentation on the hardware would come that would include a functional specification, the contact engineers to assist with problems debugging and a list of what platforms use this product.
