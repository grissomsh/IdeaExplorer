Identifying Information needed constantly traveling across Federations.
The Ireland COE has an issue that there are multiple locations for the EMC federation, meanwhile there must be information being shared between each federation/site.
No history, just brainstorming.
The solution will be as follows:

- Identify what is the type of information that doesnâ€™t change or frequently needed from intersecting departments/federation.

- Each department/site/federation needs to create a list of the missing details from other departments/sites/federation.

- After following the previous steps come up with process or a template that will be studied and built to help the data travelling process.



If the proposed idea is implemented, it shall cut down the time and push backs needed to complete a certain task or process significantly across many departments and federations, eventually leading to easier collaboration and comunication.
