COE Challenge - Process Innovation

Being a change manager ,this is a challenge what I myself face.Currently there is no tool to reduce or minimise human efforts to track the change records .Things are to be done manually rather than getting a summarised report or list.
Triage tool should pick it from the inventory for any emergency or normal changes, to nullify human errors and reduce the time consumption by creating a change record/RFC.CMDB will be more useful for pulling out list of changes that happened for the previous quarter .Current status of any CI can be consistently recorded and kept updated.This can even enable report extract as well when it comes to auditsthereby ensuring data is accuarate.
