Customer installable storage software system allow customer use their own hardware

After Windows Storage Server 2012 released with storage space rich features, 
EMC build a storage software to provide generic storage features, like:
A.Storage pool
B.RAID Group
C.Snapshots
D.Thin provisioning
....
And provides optional features for connecting to EMC upper level storage system, like:
I.Replication
II.Deduplication
III.Recoverpoint spiliter
....
This storage software can base on current KittyHawk(VNXe3200) code, make it customer installable after input a few configuration parameters:
a.Managment IP
b.Which FC/NIC for which purpose, etc..
And software itself can
c.Install hardware drives to pre-configured Linux image
d.Enable EMC storage software
c.Provide block or file service as to different edition.

Then EMC cans ships software to customer with a price <$15k and limited remote support. Then customer can install the software by itself or other EMC vendors.
1. EMC ships storage software only.
2. Customer need buy their own server to run storage software with EMC's recommendation, like:
2.1 How many 10GbE, or 8Gb FC?
2.1 How much CPU/Memory
3. Customer need buy JBOD attaching to the server
4. Customer load EMC software from CD/DVD and input a few configuration questions to enable EMC storage software.
5. After EMC storage software configured, customer can start using it as VNXe

With above solution, the new EMC product can
1. Cost less than $15k to customer, and EMC can still make profit from it
2. EMC don't need provide services to those server/HDD which is normally expensive. 
3. Customer can buy HW from vendors they like, they can even buy HDDs for home users to reduce the cost.
4. Most of current servers support hot-plug, user can change disk by theirself, storage software only need tell them which hard drive to replace by SN.(Users can tag SN in front of each HDD for easily locate)
