IoT Monitors Cars
IoT can incorporate sensors and intelligence to monitor how cars are being driven and drive intelligence of how aggressive or calm the driver is
Insurance companies try to estimate the car insurance premiums based on the driving habits of users which can include age and previous accidents history. We can take this a further  step by automatic monitoring and reporting utilizing IoT
IoT Accelerometer sensors will be embedded in all cars on roads. These will communicate via 3G networks to access gateways which will perform analytics and determine how aggressive the driver is using the car. A mobile app will be downloadable for car users and they will be able to see how the road monitoring system monitored his driving patterns. Aggressive users will be prompted to pay extra money when renewing their licenses. This has the potential to increase road safety. Also incentives can be provided for non-aggressive car drivers.
Success would mean accurate monitoring of car motion. Moreover a credible mobile application and user friendly interface. Communication medium is there (3G networks), thus there is no need incurred in communication infrastructure. A small fee for Internet connectivity can be incorporated. This has the potential of solving long unsolved traffic problem which will save lives, and if utilized in the capital of Egypt can generate a lot of revenue for EMC (if EMC decides to sell the solution)
