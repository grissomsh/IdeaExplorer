Real plants inside the office and Mfg Floor
Since EMC is making considerable effort in using less energy and making COE a green campus; having plats inside the building will rejuvinate the need to go for effecient technologies. It also helps EMC to demonstrate the effort towards a greener planet to the customers that visits the manufacturing floor at a daily basis.
I have seen the documentary of the ferrari marenallo factory and it is amazing to see the Prancing Horse being made in such a beautiful environment.

Setting small pots for plants in the corridoors and the office entrances; having small pots will be easy to maintain in terms of cleanliness and maintenance.
A better working environment; a very positive impression for the EMC customers
