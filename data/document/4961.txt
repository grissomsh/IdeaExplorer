ECC (EMC Customer connect)

Team discussions on different ways to improve customer service
Today, EMC maintains different websites/mobile apps for different products and for multiple different purposes. This means that the information is scattered all around. This solution aims at enabling single access point for all customer needs which acts as big data of all the customer information.
