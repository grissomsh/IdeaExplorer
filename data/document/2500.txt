SMART APPLICATION CONVERTER
Implementation of this idea will ease/automate technical drawing every EMC Sales SE does while generating proposal/solution doc to customer. 
I was thinking of different options to enhance PreSales service and was looking at different pain points current SEs are facing. One of major time consuming task for Presales TechDrawing team/ EMC SEs is the problem mentioned above.
Presales TechDrawing team is internally evaluating options proposed.

Upload BOM which is in text format to Application which automatically converts BOM to Drawing in customer presentable format.
First, Drawings/Stencils repository will be made for all possible line item configurations of BOM. Eg: For EMC VNX storage product all combination of Disks, Disk array enclosure, Storage Processor enclosure etc will be made as a repository in a standard format.
Each stencil repository will have one Stencil repository ID which will be used by Application to pull final drawing. Each stencil repository will be unique to a particular drawing.

Step1: Application reads and analyses each line item of BOM
Step2: After analyzing, Application decides which Stencil Repository ID is required for BOM analyzed
Step3: Application pulls drawing from the Stencil Repository ID and paste in Visio/PPT/PDF format.
To add-on, above mentioned solution is positioned as Drawing-as-a-Service where any sales engineer uploads their BOM and gets drawing report.
