Big Traffic
Smart city is the current focus,how to utilize the current technology in order to best utilize the resources , save money and Time
As more as we grow, as more as it become more challenging to manage the time wast in traffic become more challenging as well security coverage
Idea came up when i was exploring different smart city approach and realizing that the more we focus on creating smart cities the more congestions we are creating around them
Having a smart city with huge internet connection should be better utilize to offer more efficient way of transportations and reduction in the power needed

Start implementing Smart Cameras and traffic sensors
1.Smart cameras will start gathering information on current traffic statistics
  Data to be saved on the cloud and further big data analytic is used to
 A. Determine the congestions and start directing the traffic towards the less congested roads
 B. Automatic change for the light traffic based on the road capacity
 C. Analyse the time and the location for the congestions for better city planning
the
2.Using Traffic sensors to gather information on the cars, the speed the location
  A. the informations gathered will be used to find stolen cars
  B. Maintain security
  C . proactive accident  monitor based on the speed of the car and the location
  D. based on the traffic capacity in specific location at specific time, street lights can be automatically dimmed to better  Utilize power
  
-Reduce power
-utilize big data analytic for better planning
-Utilize time
-Cost reduction on a long term
