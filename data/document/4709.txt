Web-based Lightweight Unisphere for VNX/VNXe

When launch the Unisphere, it always cost us so much time. but I just want to check some information from GUI.
The Web-based Lightweight Unisphere just implements parts of the functionalities of current Unisphere:
- Should be easy to access the array information from mobile devices
- Should be quick to launch the GUI
- Can provide the necessary functionalities
