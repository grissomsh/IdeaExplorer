A simplified way to register device to RSA soft token server
Using a moderner solution to simplify our daily work and improve the work efficiency 
It caused troubles for me to register my device. Then talked it with my colleague. 
Instead of the link and code, we could use the QR-code generated from the activation link and code and send it to user. Then user could easily register their devices.
It would save much time for every employees using RSA soft token.
It may cost me around 1 minute to carefully input the link. With the QR-code, it would cost me less than 10 seconds. Considering 40,000+ employees, it would be a huge time saving.
