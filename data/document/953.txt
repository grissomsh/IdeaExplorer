US/CA CST Time And Materials  Documents on File Project
Lean six sigma process improvement
Used to receive SRs from the Vic Team with a note that the customer is having Docs on file while we are not having any docs for this specific customer.

Found that we have expired documents on file and need to clear them out.
Validate the customer Information in our Database and adjust T&M and VIC Processes Guidelines accordingly. Eliminate the negative impact that CST have on the revenue accounting team by eliminating the percentage of Error (17.6) to reach 0 percent
Hotkeys and CST Knowledge Data Base are updated To accurately Reflect the  Docs on file.

T&M Team Check to see what the customer have on file Prior to sending the Quote to the customer.

Revenue Accounting Team are being able to collect funds from Purchase orders on file instead of being unable to perform the task due to expired Purchase Orders.

Process Consistency and CSAT improvement as the customer is getting the exact same message on every SR.
