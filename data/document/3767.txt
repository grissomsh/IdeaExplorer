Measuring our Distribution Enviornment with Black Box Recordings and Apply to our Test Protocols

In 2012 a black box study was performed of a shipment that went over the road in Mexico, by rail thru the US, and by road Ayer to Franklin MA.  The response data was plotted against our input vibration protocol and we could see we were under testing in lower frequencies and way over testing in higher frequencies. (See graph attached).   Additional studies presented at the annual ISTA conference also identified the difference between actual versus test specification levels.   The realization that better data could allow for a more accurate test started the conversation and then the initiation of the project.  To date, lab and US data have been collected and the next phase of measuring road conditions in China is starting now.
Working with an outside consulting agency to supply the black box recorders and data analysis, we have initiated a program to measure actual road shipments in the US and collect data in the lab.  Road conditions in China will also be evaluated.  An analysis of actual versus the lab data will be performed.  We will be able to quantify the difference between actual responses versus responses to our test protocol completed in the lab.  We will be able to customize the vibration protocol to more accurately reflect actual conditions with some margin of safety as well.  Or, we will be able to confidently change to other industry specification protocol that we know  reflects our distribution environment.

This study ultimately will enable us reduce cost and risk ,as it will prevent over designing in our products and packs just to pass a test that is too extreme.  We will have a test protocol that will more accurately challenge our products so we can be assured we have the right level of product and package design
