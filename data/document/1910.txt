Explore New business to personal via telecom operators.
In current storage market, most of our product are sold to enterprise. It is still blank, or there still big chance for personal usage. In my solution, we could provide product/service to terminal user via telecom operators.
Today is a multi-media prevalent era. People ask more space to store their personal information. Currently, user use the third part storage e.g. "Baidu cloud". But you must apply. For some user, who do not know how to apply. If we sold storage to operators, they could sell/give the storage when telecom packages ordered. So, I think if operator could provide this to terminal user, it will be great.
In China, telecom operators sell their product in packages.
Currently, the packages include: basic telephone fee; network fee; TV fees. However, the competition is stiff among these operators. If we sell our product to these operators, they could provide the storage to every subscriber as value added service. This will help them enlarge their market. This will be an win vs. win project for operator and us. 
Open/expend low-end storage market. Make money.
