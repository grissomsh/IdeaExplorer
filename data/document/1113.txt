Cloud-based online IT infrastructure service for licensed commercial software
This idea is releveant to build an efficient, convenient and cost-saved comtemporary workplace.   
The idea was triggered by my recent worse experiene to open a Microsfot Project file, which includes our project information.  Without Project, each time,  I have to ask the file creator to send me a PDF copy,  but I cannot edit the file yet.  SO, eventually, I had to buy a Microsoft Project license to install it in my laptop.  If we have a shared software application service from IT,  this will be very helpful!
We can build up an commercial software application infrastructure, for example, application cloud and expose software applications to internal ueser though web broweser.  The application cloud can provide services, such as: 
 - File repository, which can allow user to upload or download target file
 - Use the built-in commercial software application to open the file for editing throug web broweser.  

So far, within EMC, IT and no any department provide such shared service.  This idea can be worth a try.   
We can build up a commercial software application cloud infrastructure based on Syncplicity and expose software applications to internal ueser through web broweser.  The application cloud can provide services, such as: 
 - File repository, which can allow user to upload or download target file
 - Use the built-in commercial software application to edit the file throug web broweser interface or other Unified GUI client
 - The cloud can be easy to integrate any new commecial software application based on the request survey among EMC employees
 - Provide access control to files through individual or group

The idea will benefit to EMC and EMC employee users through:  
 - Save money by shared commercial software 
 - Improve daily work efficience and convenience without the purchasing process
 - Improve collaboration among project memebers by shard files
