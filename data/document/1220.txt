License Agents Dispatch SRs That Needs Field Assistance 
NA
Several negative feedback from customers as license team would not provide closure to customers. 
Licensing team would dispatch the SR themselves where customers need assistance from the field specifically with the VNX cases. Currently, license team would ask the customer to contact his CS team which creates negative CSAT. 

With the new solution, license agents would put the customer in direct contact with the field. 
Customers would get a final resolution without asking them to do extra tasks or contact more people. 
Better customer service and faster resolutions.
