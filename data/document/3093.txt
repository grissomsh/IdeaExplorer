Service Request "Customer Heat" Indicator
N/A
Worked with Samer Youssry and George Gabra to address the outlines and details mentioned above.

Summary:
1-Proactive Management follow up with the customers when there is a potential of dissatisfaction enhances the customer's experience with EMC support and increases their overall satisfaction with the provided service.
2-According to analysis and feedback; the following points might trigger customerâ€™s dissatisfaction:
-Missed SLO.
-Multiple SR ownership changes.
-Any delay in technical escalation to next level.
-Missing commitments with the customer during the SR life time.
-Customer showed frustration or unhappiness during the SR life time.
-Any technically escalated issues to L2 or engineering.
-DU/DL & Code Red.
-Language barriers (MLS).
-Multiple MOD calls received till the service request assigned.
-Service Request Age.
-Magisterially Escalated SRs "E1/E2/E3/E4".
-Re-Opened Service Requests.


Goals:
-Need to increase the Management team and Support Engineers awareness and implement a notification method and indicator about service requests with potentially dissatisfied customers.

 
Proposed Solution:
-Add a new functionality to the service center and Qtools to highlight service requests with potentially dissatisfied customers.
-This can be done by a new indicator called "Customer Heat".
-The "Customer Heat" indicator color "Green -> Yellow -> Orange -> Red" changes according to a driven value calculated by the following points:
1-Number of SR "Assignments".
2-Technical Escalation/Bug/PeerReview linked to the SR or L2 tasks opened "technically escalated issues".
3-Service Request Age >28 days.
4-Opened Management Escalation according to the escalation level.
5-Service Requests with re-opened status.
6-Late assignment of the service request.
7-Data Loss/Unavailability triggered.
8-Number of MOD calls received for the service request.
-The "Customer Heat" indicator will be visible only for Managers/WFMs and for TSEs once the case is accepted.
 

Responsibility and Ownership:
-The manager keeps follow up with the service request owner on SRs with potentially dissatisfied customers according to the "Customer Heat" indicator color.
-TSE should notify his manager before closing a service request with "Customer Heat" indicator color is "Yellow, Orange or Red".
-The manager have to perform a proactive follow up with the customer and take the needed actions to enhance the customer's experience.
