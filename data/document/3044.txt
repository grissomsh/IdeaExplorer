This will require developing archiving connector framework so that developers will have specific interface to develop connectors/jobs which could come with metadata about configurations to be changed by archiving admins. The framework is responsible for execution of the connectors/jobs and configuring them in user friendly GUI. The connectors can be uploaded to the store by developers later on and be sold to others.

Then InfoArchive customers and partners can browse the store and download the required connectors which are configured to archive the designated systems. I dream to build something like IFTTT for InfoArchive, i.e. making a modular connector framework.

- It allows customer to gr
