Centralized automated VPLEX installer

We see customers buy multiple VPLEX instances. Given that VPLEX installation is a complex process, installing and configuring all the VPLEX instances will consume more time and is prone to errors. Having a centralized automated VPLEX installer will improve TCE.
There is a centralized VPLEX installer component. This can run on a separate machine or on one of the VPLEX cluster. This VPLEX installer will discover other VPLEX instances in the environment and also its states.

VPLEX installer will have interfaces to install/upgrade/configure the discovered VPLEX instance. This way, all VPLEX instances can be managed from a single user interface.
