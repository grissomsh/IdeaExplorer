computer program for automated test case design and test scenario generation

This idea came up while brainstorming about how to solve our regular manual and automation challenges. The idea was submitted to the patent committee but yet to hear a response on the same. It is under internal evaluation. We have worked on POC and it is ready for demonstration.
