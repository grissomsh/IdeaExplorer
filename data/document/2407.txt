Matrix Authentication based on answer coordinates
With expanding use of connected devices, a convenient yet secure authentication method becomes necessary. Our solution precludes the need to switch between mobile keyboard screens, and instead implements a secure password-entry method which is particularl
The idea come to us at 2015 RSA Hackathon
1. Enrollment: Client chooses password and matrix (authentication) strength.
2. Upon Authentication request from the client, the server builds a randomly-ordered ASCII matrix containing the characters of the userâ€™s password as well as a random selection of other characters.
3. The server converts that matrix to an image and sends it to the client side.
4. The client displays to the user the matrix image.
5. The end-user identifies the symbols that comprise their password inside image, and clicks on each character in order.
6. The client records the ordered coordinates selected by the end-user.
7. The client sends the ordered list of coordinates to the server.
8. The server assembles the password that had been entered using both the returned coordinates and the matrix it had generated in step 1 above, at which point it can determine authentication success or failure.

1. Security: 
  a. There is no password transferred between the client and server. Instead, only an image is transferred.
  b. The image generated by the server changes every time, with password characters being assigned to coordinates randomly as well as
