SLA For engineering

Wonder why Engineering don't have an SLA when we engage them. If face this issue day-in & day-out. Once we log an engineering ticket.. they run with it for weeks & months without updates.(i may have exaggerated it a bit) but while we wait for an update it is the end customer who suffers & things falls apart from there.
Our Customers have SLAs to run with.
Our partners have SLAs. Field has SLAs. Support & delivery teams have SLAs.
Internal IT team have SLAs !!

Come up with practical SLAs for Engineering team to respond to CS(or any other team) when they are engaged. This will ensure faster response time = Better TCE.
