 Resend the Message! – a new approach for easier management and effective employees’ engagement in Egypt COE

 The idea came in from visualizing the huge employees hierarchy and visualizing it as if it was a network of senders and receivers (inspired by the communication networks topologies)
To make sure that a large number of employees are directed to the correct target, one pillar to achieve this is to ensure that they all get the same vision.

The idea works as follows : 
-	First, a certain message is delivered from the COE management to the employees (for example : this year’s mission statement or call for innovation roadmap)
-	Then after sometime the management will start to rehear this message from employees meaning that some employees across many BUs/Geos will deliver the message to the management.
-	Management will then assess how the message was delivered and will make sure it is correct or take corrective actions if needed
The idea will enable the management team to anticipate issues (related to miscommunication) before they happen.
