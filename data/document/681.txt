Performance Management Training
Improve training provided to first line managers in order to manage performance of their subordinates
As Isilon support manager, I found a lot of employees dissatisfied of performance appraisal as well as performance management system. Moreover, when I work with supervisors and Team leads, I found that they have received inadequate training regarding tools that will be use in managing their employees performance.
