nGINs (Next Generation Innovation leaders)	
High dependency on small pool of talent in the BU makes too few people hold critical knowledge and critical competencies. Losing them will have a severe impact on the BU and the COE and in addition, the same critical individuals are occupied with innovation opportunities besides their daily work in the BU.
Innovation is known to be formed by heterogenic groups, people who are sitting around a table coming from different disciplines (e.g, Technology, Sales, Product, etc.). 

The innovation team wanted to grow the next generation of innovators to expend circle of innovation due to resource limitation while working with the BUs. The HR in the same time was starting to prepare a plan to develop and retain high-potentials. When the innovation manager arrived to the HR to ask to develop a program, HR thought it was a great match that can address both objectives. 
We offer a successful COE program that can travel and grow the next innovation leaders in EMC. Training people, more tech innovation leaders will significantly take forward the competitiveness of the BU products. EMC will retain its best people by enabling them to be more engaged, influential and recognized. We expect the nGIN team will influence wider circles, will cascade skills, bring in new energy and state of mind
HR developed and executed in ’14-‘15 the program and worked with a selected group of employees with much success, feedback from the participants as well as the BU leaders was tremendous . We suggest expending the program to other audiences in EMC/COEs.
