Workforce Mobility
Utilizing EHC to access all systems and tools from any device would improve Time to Respond (TTR) to customer needs, improve end user work environments improving customer experience, and work/life balance while providing an environment Millennials expect.
EOS2 PLM Operations team held a brainstorming session on utilizing the EHC to improve services.  This idea is new and being developed for the CTO challenge.
Utilizing EHC could provide the infrastructure to manage both internal and external applications.  Having the ability to connect to the outside world to include social media, IoT, accessibility to systems from home, EHC could provide a 3rd platform environment.  This would improve the integration of work and home systems, improve accessibility to internal applications and provide true mobility for end users.  Millennials would like the have a work environment that is there own, meaning flexibility to work from a coffee shop, home, or even the beach accessing both their work and personal environments all on the same platform.  The solution would allow software developers to develop code, testing teams to run regression, lab teams to spin up environments for customers utilizing EHC and access assets, tools, and solution environments, from anywhere, anytime and @scale.  This system can also manage the automated profiles and validation of users to enable a content management solution.
Mobility of the workforce would improve both EOS2 service offerings, as well as being progressive in understanding how to attract the next generation of workers.  EHC - hybrid workforce solution for this and the next gen.
