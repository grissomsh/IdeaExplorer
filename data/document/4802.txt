Reduce service/warranty cost - Based on customer segmentation!!

As part of Global VNXe team, we have witnessed many instances where customer are too demanding in spite of just having one single SMB box and don't want to engage Professional Services at all, where we have opportunity for revenue generation.As is in current scenario we struggle day in & out on expectation setting.

As part of offering we need to come up with new and different SOP's, Policies & Procedures based on customer segmentations, as we have witnessed some of the customer enjoying privileges of Enterprise Customer when they have SMB Products, expectations are different for these customer, where cost of services if often more than our margins / revenues.
