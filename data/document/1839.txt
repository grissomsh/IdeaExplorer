Federation Knowledge Sharing Network
Create a knowledge sharing forum across all EMC and Federation business units to foster a spirit of awareness, collaboration, communication and networking.
EMC (and now the Federation) has so many business functions in the Cork area. In addition the product and solution portfolio is expanding. It is quite difficult to develop an understanding of the entire EMC Federation network of roles and offerings. It would be great to leverage our close proximity to have short, fun and informative sessions.
Each of the major business units commits to periodically hosting ‘lunch and learn’ type sessions. The purpose of which is to provide a very high level (20 minute) overview of a product, solution or business area.
In parallel we develop a portal to allow all Federation employees register an interest in any area of the business.
When a session is planned, interested employees are invited to attend these sessions which should be informal, informative and fun.

At a minimum this would lead to a more informed Federation workforce but it would also:
Provide a holistic view of our business which would lead to better communication, increased collaboration. This would provide us with a foundation to develop innovative business solutions and ideas across our organization.
Higher awareness of the many roles across our company, leading to career development opportunities.
