Too afraid to apply for a job here? We understand and help.
getting more people wanting to work for our company
no history here, I just was reminded of how long it took for me to get a decent job after finishing university
lower the requirements in job postings:
- Getting woman into technology focused jobs can be difficult so to tackle that, don't scare potential applicants away by setting the barrier too high.
- For example a bachelors degree is not needed. Especially young persons and immigrants might not have it but they are smart and could get the degree later on while working for EMC and having a constant income of money.

offer internships:
- Get people in by offering a peak into our company, internships and the Skillnets program are a good starting points and should be expanded.

paid college / university:
- Attract smart people early by offering them a 20h week minimum wage and paying for an evening course college (4 years for bachelor degree).

open career day:
- Promote information days in local schools as well as in social media sites and newspapers and job websites.
- Interested people can then be shown around the various departments in EMC, for example someone interested in IT can sit down with our Engineering Team or a people focused person will have the opportunity to see live what's it like working in HR or in the Scheduling & Dispatch Team.
- that could reduce the scare factor for applying for a job because the potential candidates have human live interaction and see that we are not Supermans
- involves some costs for EMC, which will pay of in the long run and may even save money on looking + hiring of new employees
- getting more people to apply for jobs, especially those that would have been too shy otherwise
- creating interest early for a job at EMC
- securing motivated workforce with the paid college / university study for the length of the study and there is a good chance of retaining them after
