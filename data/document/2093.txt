Dynamic storage activity monitoring based on usage frequency.
User maybe need perform several steps before the final operation. If our management GUI could use a smart way to shortcut the most popular operation steps to one step only operation. It will give user a better experience.
As a testing engineer, easy to use is part of my work. For the most frequently used operations if it could be abstract a simple step. I will be better.
User maybe need perform several steps before the final operation. If our management GUI could use a smart way to shortcut the most popular operation steps to one click only operation. It will give user a better experience.

Enable a mechanism/algorithm based on usage frequency. This method could analyze and record user's usage habit.
After that, we can calculate the top N operation, summary them to a shortcut on management GUI(Unisphere). Next time, user could easily go to target operation without additional operation.

E.g. In current Rockies, if you want to check Lun compression summary. You need following operations.
1. Open Unisphere;
2. Go to "Storage" tab;
3. Move mouse to left panel;
4. Select "Select Lun Summary", and view the summary.

The same operations are needed for "Deduplication" and "Migration" summary.
If we abstract this to a shortcut, these operations will be one step only. It will be much easier for user.
We also could apply this in "report" area.
Customer may be satisfied with this change.
