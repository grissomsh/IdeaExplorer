Smart IT Support Specialist
This idea proposes a innovative method to resolve an IT ticket quickly. Also tries to find the solution with single search for the problem. It tries to cutdown the communication gap between end user and IT specialist.  It builds the intelligence automatic
I have raised several tickets. I feel resolving an issue with chat/ticket/email/phone takes more time for the solution. Hence better process is required.
Whenever IT support solves an issue it should goto DB. After the problem is resolved support person should rephrase the problem mentioned by user and solution given in few lines. This should also have name of application, its version, OS, time etc...The DB should be searchable by text, audio(text-to-speech) and even picture if possible(attached by user). Whenever user raises a ticket, chat, phone the DB should get searched automatically in parallel. User can be given an option to look at the closest solution or it might help support person in resolving the issue.  If there is any confidential info it should be removed while constructing DB. Currently IT self-help has information more on How-To kind of issues. Searching in inside.emc.com is tedious. Finding the closest mach for your problem itself will take more time than getting assistance from IT for an user. Whereas this approach looks at the solution given by IT support and gives the same answer or closest answers to the issue already resolved by IT.
Reduces manual effort for IT and hence cost
enduser satisfaction and instant answers especially when they are away from desk
