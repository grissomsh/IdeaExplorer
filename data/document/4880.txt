Use the charity money for advertising for new behavior.

COE couldn’t use the charity money for less known organization or organization which don’t have formal papers to be that known organization.
o We are donating money to charity legal organizations such as Resala, 57357, el orman….etc.  All those organizations are already relatively well funded by other parties and they use a lot of these funds in advertisement and asking for people help. All the while, there are other less known organizations that do not enjoy the same level of fame and funding.  So why doesn’t EMC in addition to what was mentioned earlier, also focus on  advertising through some sort of media outlet for good/decent/charitable behavior which would in turn influence people to try and find these lesser known entities (who could probably really use the charity money more than their more famous counterparts) instead of taking the easy way out and going to the bigger famous organizations 
o While we’re at it, why not also use this media outlet to advertise for a better general behavior like proper driving manners/ethics such as sticking to lanes while driving without randomly drifting out….etc. This could be of great general benefit to our society
