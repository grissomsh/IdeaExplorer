Share your excess Food with the Needy
Everyday in the cafeteria, we see the amount of wasted food being updated along with the number of people who could have been fed. Sometimes, when we order food, we don't have control over the size and proportion of the meal. And the other times, we just don't know how much food is required to fill ourselves. This in turn results in food wastage.
Everyday after washing my hands in the cafeteria (Tower B), I would see the board being updated with the amount of food wasted and the number of people who could have been fed. The numbers seemed to be constant since quite sometime. 

I came across this "Share my Dabba" initiative being taken up in Mumbai. Here the consumers of the dabba system use stickers to mark their food inside the tiffin fit for sharing.

We can use a similar concept where the employees can also willingly share their excess food.
The idea is to have boxes (disposable/non-disposable) available in the cafeteria. A person can take up a box, keep the excess food inside and place it at another specified location. Here the presumption is that the people who will willingly share their food will have the basic humane-ness to not keep inside messy, unclean food (leftovers).

These boxes can then be taken outside to distribute the food to the street children.
This idea, if implemented well, can be one of the CSR activities of the company. Here each employee would feel directly involved in this social activity. Apart from helping the hungry underprivileged people out, this idea will also strengthen the company's social outlook.
