Implementation of an Ideal method to reuse the energy thereby improving efficiency of Servers / Storage Array Subsystem by converting the waste Heat emitted by the Servers / Storage Array Subsystem components into electricity. 

Waste heat is a byproduct of nearly all electrical devices. These kinds of waste heats are useful sources of energy, and can be recovered and used to produce electricity. 
As processors, RAM, hard drives and other components in Servers or Storage Array Subsystem have increased in speed and power consumption, the amount of heat generated by these components as a side-effect of normal operation has also increased.Waste Heat Recovery methods help in reusing this heat, which may otherwise go wasted.



The amount of heat generated by the servers or the storage subsystem components is often treated as waste and is lost to the environment.
The catch is, there is energy in that waste heat and there is a way to capture it and put it to work to produce usable electricity.
The present invention relates to a method or apparatus to be used in the servers or storage subsystem for converting the waste heat generated from the server or storage subsystem components to usable electricity.
The electricity produced from this waste heat can be further used to,
•	Power up the systems
•	Charge the batteries
•	Operate the fans
