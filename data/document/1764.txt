Like! for EMC/VNX Products
EMC/VNX should complete feedback loop from customers/community to Product development so that EMC stays relevant to customer’s requirement, customer usage of EMC Products.
Recently I took course in Design thinking. Design thinking has “empathize” as first stage. Few years ago, I spend one day at Level-2 support to understand customer issues. No all developer can interact with customer for feedback. So it’s must that enterprise product itself are ready to generate feedback for our product roadmap.
1. Collect support material and after removing necessary security info, make it available to Development team for analysis.
2. Write good algorithm to identify list of most used features, how they are used, filesystem sizes, layout on various Disk technologies that help define work-load information , ckpt schedule, overall ckpt count used, how frequently are they created, was migration used, how is DR strategy implemented etc.
3. Add “feedback from community and above process to improve product development (e.g. no regression on most used CLIs or GUI pages, performance improvements for these features, deliver more features relevant).
4. Add this process to Fspec itself.

1.      Continuous integration with Customer feedback.
2.      Overall regression reduction due to improved processes
3.      Better customer satisfaction level for EMC enterprise products.
