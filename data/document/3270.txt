Allow EMC Employees (Field, Pre-Sales, Implementation) to work with Engineering and vis-versa

I was not allowed to add Implementation Engineer (case contact) name in a tool called JIRA for the updates to directly reach.
The Field, Pre-Sales, Implementation engineers working on the issue (Who opens the Service Request), gets notified directly from the engineering tickets and fulfills the requirement (Logs, Action plan)with/without the involvement of CS.
CS can concentrate on customer contact issues.
