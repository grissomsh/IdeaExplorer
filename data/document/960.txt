Packaged DevOPS Services added with container orchestration frame work for EHC
The proposed solution is directly relevant to the Challenge in terms of optimizing the lab resource usage 
We brainstormed on utilizing the Docker containers for devOps on demand provisioning and came up with the proposed design
This solution proposes setting up DevOps with Docker Container integration and automation framework.  The docker container storage can be provisioned through scale-out COTS product ScaleIO. The EHC portal can be integrated to Cloud foundry and with vagarant, packer tools along with Docker Container orchestration. 

Apps and data instances can begin quickly and agile. Life cycle management for resources and Governance can be achieved with the help of orchestration.

Multi container orchestration can help with Live migration and HA for microservices.

Benefits

- Fewer SAN connections as the containers can share the same connections
- faster time to deployment
- lower failure rate of new releases
- shortened lead time between fixes
- faster time to recovery
- maximize the predictability, efficiency, security, and maintainability of operational processes


EMC infrastructure can be very much integrated and optimized by leveraging Docker technology.
