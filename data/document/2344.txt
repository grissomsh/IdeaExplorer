Drive Recovery
The new process would save $300k per Qtr. enabling investment in the journey to the 3rd platform.

Design and deploy a process that enables the carrier to be replaced on a cosmetically damaged drive.
$1.2m cost saving annually.

A quick and efficient process of recovering a valuable drive cost effictivly.
Improve agility by being able to perform physical drive conversions in 10% of the time it currently takes.
