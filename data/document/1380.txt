Random shots to form a snapshot.
The idea is to build an application to avoid system/application freeze
This idea is analogous to shot technology in recent mobile phone camera which captured the images  of the object while the object is moving.
We capture random snapshots while a system/application is running and consolidate them to form a  
Consistent snapshot.

Customers satisfaction which will not cause application freeze with slightest disturbance to the productivity. Can also make money as the features are improved as this might be needed for a tier-1 application.
