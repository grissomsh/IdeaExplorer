Enhancing car security by an in house approach
Car crime reached a peak in the early 1990s when 700,000 cars were stolen in a single year.
Thanks largely to the efforts of vehicle manufacturers, and insurers, a vehicle-owning household is now around five times* less likely to become a victim of vehicle-related theft than in 1995 but there were still more than 75,000 cars stolen in 2013, of which more than half will never be recovered.
Back in the 1990s most car theft was committed by opportunists and so-called joyriders but today it is restricted mainly to the activities of organized criminal gangs.  Cars are frequently stolen to order to fund other criminal activity and are often shipped overseas, which is painful with high-end cars like Ferrari, Volvo, Lamborghini,....etc.
I thought about the idea when I read a topic about the total number of stolen cars and the organized crimes that can be a result.


in the IoT Era the cars will be a source of a flood of information which needs new security paradigms.
Add the RSA token to the car key and navigation systems into the car to add a new layer of security that will help in the IoT era which will lead not only the physical car security but also the information generated by the car user and navigation information.

The approach will be a great benefit to the car rental user information security. 
More security for the cars will reduce the total number of crimes.
