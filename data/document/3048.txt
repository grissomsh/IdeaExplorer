The BigData journey started as paort of "Build a hybrid cloud live" on the top of EMC Enterpirse Hybrid cloud in EMC world 2014, and then prodctised as part of EHV2, EHC2.5 and EHC 3.0, And now more advanced Elastic Hybrid data lakes to address the 2nd and third platform data cand analytic changeless. And this current solution The Distributed Resource and Cluster Manager for Elastic Hybrid Data lakes (BigData 3rd Platform)  built on Apache Mesos allows  us to share a pool of servers that can all run different parts of your application without them interfering with each other and with the ability to dynamically allocate resources across the cluster as needed. That means, it could easily switch resources away from framework1 (for example, doing big-data analysis) and allocate them to  framework2 (for example, a web server), if there is heavy network traffic. It also reduces a lot of the manual steps in deploying applications and can shift workloads around automatically to provide fault tolerance and keep utilization rates high.
. 
The Current proposal combines the best of YARN and Mesos, allowing modern Hadoop workloads to run elastically with other datacenter and cloud workloads, thereby sharing resources with all of the organization's Linux applications (e.g., web servers, Java apps) as well as their datacenter services like Cassandra, Kafka, Elasticsearch, and Kubernetes.
Running YARN on the same cluster as other datacenter services and applications dramatically increases utilization and agility while reducing operational complexity and cost. With this approach, operations teams can meet the needs of data scientists and developers with one set of resources without being hamstrung by the need for YARN to run in isolation, on dedicated clusters.

It will significantly reduses infrastructure costs by not having separate clusters for Hadoop and non-hadoop workloads in a data center, Running YARN on the same cluster as other datacenter services and applications dramatically increases utilization and
