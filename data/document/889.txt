GSAP usually would hit the floor and would not understand how to provide
Realizing the current challenges  faced by new joinees specially GSAP this project would be beneficial in smooth transitioning to production support . This would help existing team members to upgrade their skills in other product 

Target project provides a unique location to all CS engineers to reduce time in researching about the existing trainings and tools through different portals of EMC.

Solution :Tool Refresher Document(Provides help to the associates where they can get to most used terms)
Solution :MYPRODUCT training document.(Document which would have details of product specific tools and training list_
This idea is being worked at the CS level in India.
Except for manhours from each of us, there is no other cost involved to execute this idea.
This would help the GSAPers to get into production in short span of them
