LED Lights for EMC Offices world wide

I am sure this must have been discussed before but I really hope to see all EMC offices use LEDlamps instead of florecent 
Replacing all offices headlights to use LED light, the only cost is buying the new LED lamps itself, this will make on the long run big cost saving in powerand maintenance.

There is no need to change any structure or installation replacing LED to replace florecent lambs has never been easier.
