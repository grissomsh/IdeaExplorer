Animated demonstrations on importance of STEM, Big Data and cloud

Sessions with practical examples are more effective than normal method of teaching. 
1) Students will understand better if topics are explained to them with practical examples than theoretical. Instead of spending on personally going to schools/colleges personally and teaching students the importance of STEM, a one time effort can be made to create case studies with practical examples of importance of STEM will make students understand it much better.

2) At the end of the animation an assessment can be created and ask the student to attend the same to assess his understanding

3) Similar methodology can be followed for educating students on EMC big data and cloud technologies.

4) Making complex things simpler will make things more achievable.
