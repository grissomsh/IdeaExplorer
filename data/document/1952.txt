Xtrem Availability
Create a new use case for XtremIO in our traditional markets.  

Use XtremIO's deduplication to efficiently store source and target databases for database replication. 
This idea developed from internal conversations about how to make Postgres nearly as available as Oracle RAC.
1. Use database layer replication [ available with Oracle, SQL, Exchange, DB2, PostgreSQL ] and replicate from source to target hosts.
2. Place XtremIO under both the source and target.  This should enjoy near-perfect deduplication.
3. Fail-over from the source to target no longer requires starting the database on the target node.
4. We can sell this is RAC-like recoverability for non-Oracle RAC databases
We could partner with the rest of the database world with a cost effective, XtremIO-based solution which delivers RAC-like failover times.
