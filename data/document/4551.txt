RCM scheduler to send Automatic E-mail to Customer with the FTP Code Link when Upgrade via WEBEX is scheduled.  

When I first started working with RCM there was so much to learn in a short period of time. I was scheduling upgrades via ESRS which gives the option right after the upgrade is scheduled to schedule a code transfer. The WEBEX upgrades the PCE needs to send the FTP File Code Link to the customer via e-mail after the Upgrade is scheduled. In the beginning as a new PCE I was often forgetting to send the FTP links in the upgrade confirmation e-mail, and I had to send a second e-mail to customers with the FTP Code Link to make sure the Code was downloaded to the customerâ€™s desktop before the upgrade. I remember having a nightmare once that I forgot to send the link via e-mail to the customer, this really happened to me, funny to talk about it now! 
With this approach, the scheduling process will reduce errors and save time for the PCE by not having to send the codes to the customer. The idea will be just like scheduling the ESRS scheduling process which is already in use, where the code transfer is scheduled automatically after the upgrade is scheduled. The customer will receive an auto e-mail from RCM with a professional appearance with the files that needs to be downloaded.
