Big Data Driven Elevator based on EVP solution

Everyday I suffered a lot for the ThyssenKrupp Elevator, I hope this situation can be improved a little bit.
Leverage the internet of things to enables the operation information being collected and gathered: statistics, power usage, load, average waiting time, tracks, etc.

Leverage the EVP solution, big data, could computing to study the behaviors of the elevator for this specific building and finding out patterns. Afterwards, the elevator can be scheduled in a more optimized way to alleviate the pressure when load is high.
