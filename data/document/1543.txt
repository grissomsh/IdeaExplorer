working on backup for VMware cloud solutions
EMC should provide the DD Boost protocol with necessary API to backup to Data Domain from open stack cloud environment. As EMC DD boost already have backups solutions with Database & application, same can be extended to the Open stack Cloud platform integration with necessary API’s  to have a complete solution. Charge back model can also be integrated to provide the cost details. This solution would help customers to meet their SLA’s with desired RPO & RTO.

First in the industry to have backup complete solution for open stack cloud platform.
