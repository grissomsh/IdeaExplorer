Standardize project delivery-Professional Services

The idea came to me when I presented a session with my team for a new product launched. The session was effective in terms of getting people acquainted with the new product and I have seen them using the presentation when they are doing the project on that product for the first time. 
Develop a Single team consisting of resources from different project teams (PM,SA,IS etc.) that will 
1. Create Knowledge Decks – on how BEST to do a particular product-oriented project along with 
Templates and workflow on particular projects.
2. Direct Sessions on effective project delivery and share their experiences with the team.
3. Teams to collaborate among themselves to facilitate knowledge sharing to provide new team members an effective “starting point"
4. The teams will own their respective decks and use EMC|One for their document upkeep and version control.
