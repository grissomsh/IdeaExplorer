3rd Platform: How do staff prepare for the new business opportunities ?

The idea is based on helping staff to identify a persona that represents their current role. Mapping the current role to a 3rd platform role will help with staff development and more readily tailor training needs to the 3 platform requirements. 
Develop a persona for typical platform  2 roles and how these roles could map to 3rd platform requirements. The idea here would help staff to understand the behaviours and competencies required to be successful in the 3rd platform environment.
