Leverage Big data analysis for energy saving in our array

come out the idea when see the challenge.
Every business or organization has some kind of working routine or practice, its peak time, rest time etc.

These legacy data is not leverage in the past days, but they are much valuable data for us to define power-saving strategy without impact to customer's production.

Below is the way to implement power-saving module:
1. Array is running with its full speed in the beginning, but recording the I/O history in certain data store.

2. After monitoring certain period, power-saving module will do history data analysis and get the rough rush hour and rest hour and prompt suggestion to customer in management console to implement power-saving strategy.

3. Once customer adopt the strategy, the CPU will be turn slow during rest time and save the energy.

4. The power-saving module will continuously collect the history, if the power pattern changed, new suggestion will be provided to customer.
