Create open sourced version of hardware(array/switch/host) simulators based on the existing ones developed by ViPR QE team
Russia COE Open Source Challenge

Open source the simulator programs will help the CoprHD(open sourced version of ViPR Controller) contributors for their development/testing.
The idea comes up from my daily work with ViPR testing. We develop/maintain different types of simulators. As ViPR Controller is open sourced as CoprHD, the simulators should also be available to open source players.
ViPR QE team is maintaining some hardware simulator programs such as:

    1. VMAX/VNX array simulator;
    2. HDS array simulator;
    3. XtremIO array simulator;
    4. CISCO switch simulator;
    5. Windows host simulator.

ViPR QE team developed them because there is no such open source project like them. They are very useful for ViPR Controller development and testing since hareware array/switch/host are not always available.

After CoprHD is open sourced, developers out of EMC will take part in the development/testing of CoprHD. They also need the simulators. If we open source the simulators, we can:

    1. Make outside players easier to develop CoprHD;
    2. Involve outside players to contribute to the simulators development;
    3. Improve the simulators.
