Office or not

I usually have to ping and ask if a person is in Office, which I feel is sometimes rude. In case I already know an employee is in office, I can call for a quick meeting/ discussion. Also using this app, I can decide to go to office if the concerned team/person I am supposed to meet is already in office.
We can use the swipe in to check if the person is in office. The maps of floor is already available and based on these data , it can be known if a person is present in office.
