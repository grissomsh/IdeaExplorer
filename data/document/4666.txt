Certification to compliment or extend current ECDL certification

This idea originated from a GBS Idea Generation Session.
To gain interest in a newly created certification process, we would need to be able to draw up this proposal in conjunction with a recognized body that would approve the participation scope which could include projects to achieve certification in Big Data, Cloud Computing & Data Analysis. Students would then be able to engage in these certification projects through a host of different challenges and in-school workshops to achieve certification. The idea or practical parts of the certification would include team projects that could generate different perspectives on subjects like Big Data or cloud computing. EMC would be able to include in house examples of various challenges and gain valuable insight into alternative ways of potentially problem solving an issue.
