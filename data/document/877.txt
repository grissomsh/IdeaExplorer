Paperless submission of Bills
Around the world we use 1 million tonnes of paper every day. Too much of this paper usage is wasteful and unnecessary and puts huge pressures on the environment.
All of us receive our bills via emails. We usually claim out telephone/internet bills at our payroll website or concor. Here we would take the printout of the claim and the bills and submit them. The amount of paper being wasted is tremendous.
We can do our bit to save this environment by claiming telephone/internet bills at our payroll website or Concor by uploading only the soft copy. The time required to have this approved also get reduced drastically.
Trees are one of the most valuable natural resources we have. They literally form the foundations of many natural systems and provide us with numerous benefits 

Reducing our paper usage provides environmental and economic benefits:
     · Fewer natural resources will be used for the production of paper.
     · Air and water emissions from the production of paper will be reduced.
     · Less space will be needed for the management and storage of paper documents.
     · We'll spend less to buy paper.
     · We'll save on supplies and maintenance of printers and copiers.
     · We'll have less paper waste, lowering our costs for recycling and disposal, 
        and reducing our impacts on the municipal waste stream.
