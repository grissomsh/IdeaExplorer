Innovation Promotion
 The innovation idea loses it's value if it did not spread. So this promotion will spread the ideas (that reached the finals) for all the previous years, and will make it easy for everyone to have a look on the ideas. Maybe it also help them in thinking of new ideas.
When I think of an idea, I always have the feeling maybe someone had this idea already. And I can't find a reference to be able to check the previous ideas. Thus I thought of this idea.

This idea will give more value for the innovation competition we do every year. It will make it easier for everyone to have a look on the previous ideas and maybe this promotion will help to innovate more. And give more value for our peoples ideas
