EMC India Employee Transport Service improvement by implementing Automated Core Transport Scheduling System (ACTSS)
EMC India faces great challenge in managing flexible, efficient and cost effective cab service for the people who are working in shifts. The proposed Automated Core Transport Scheduling System  addresses all these issues. 
I got this idea when I had difficulties with cab so many times in the past. In many occasions I had struggled to guide the route to the driver to my home to pick me up with language barrier.  Please go to the below link for the detailed presentation about this idea

By developing and implementing an automated core transport scheduling system integrating with Google map and mobile apps, EMC employees can book/modify/cancel the cab reservation easily within thirty minutes of on-boarding from their smartphone without calling to transport helpdesk. Cab driver can use GPS and Smartphone app to pick and drop employees with efficient communication and navigation system. It helps efficient use of limited number of cab resources and save money by reducing the number of cabs running in each route by dynamic allocation of seats in cab for each employee on time. Part of Money saved from this automated scheduling system can be used to provide the AC cab for employees since most of the Indian cities are highly polluted that can affect employee health in long term. So by successfully implementing this system EMC can save money and also increase the employee satisfaction.
1) It can save minimum of 30% of the operational cost by efficiently filling up all the seats in cab. At present only 60% of the seats are filled.  
2) It will increase the customer satisfaction by increasing the flexibility and convenience in booking/cha
