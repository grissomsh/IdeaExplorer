VNX Object-based Data Access API for third-party application integration

When I learn the could storage and OpenStack Swift.
We can implement a object-based driver based on the File and Block layer, this object-based driver can simulate the object-based data access interface based on the File and Block.

By the Object-based Storage Access API, the third-party application can:
- Can directly store the object into the array 
- Can directly retrieve the object from the array
- Can directly copy the object 
- Can delete object 
- Can control which users can do which operation
