A Day On The Go
This will address the 2 challenges listed below. 
COE employees are increasing every month with new hires and people do not know each other. 
Networking is proven to be a huge success factor on individual levels and company level. 
Every week, a meeting room is reserved or the (FLEX room) for the day and a team member is pulled from every department and is work that day from there. It will be a day working on the go! 
Employees will get to form connections and network which is extremely important to EMC. 
You will get to know what other departments do and ask questions. 
you will form a great idea about the Egypt COE and can explain to anyone what we do.
