 ATE approach "Analyze To Enhance" -  Big Data Analytics approach for EMC products continuous enhancement

 The idea did stem from the application of big data analytics in social media to process the customer reviews. I started to visualize EMC arrays as the customer and the logs to be their reviews describing the status, errors and events happening to them.


 The idea works as follows:

-	EMC arrays logs and configuration files are periodically collected and moved to a central warehouse
-	The warehouse will be divided into data marts. Each data mart will be specialized to one EMC product (for example: warehouse for VNX logs and data)
-	Big Data analytics techniques will run centrally on the huge amount of logs and data collected from thousands of arrays.
-	Big data techniques used are like :
o	association techniques to detect relations between different issues and problem triggers
o	time series analysis to monitor array behavior over time and detect seasonality of the issues (if any)
-	after processing the data, a report will be returned to the Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) team and the product engineering team denoting the possible issues/bugs 
-	the engineering and development team do their tests and take corrective action.
