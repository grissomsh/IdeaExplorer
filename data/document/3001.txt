Reclimation, Recycle and Reuse of EMC plastic front-panels and consoles
This project is based around environment waste reduction through the use of reclaiming EMC front-panels, consoles and misc. plastic.  The initiative will focus on technology and partnerships to allow the reclaimed material to be processed in a manner that
This idea was formed based on discussions w/ Protech.  Protech generate approx 30 tons of regrind (waste) every year. Currently this is sold to scrap dealers.  They are working on an initiative to eliminate their waste stream through reclamation of this product.  EMC product would fall inline w/ this initiative and also allow EMC to eliminate our waste stream for product through reclamation and reuse.
Under this initiative, EMC would partner with Protech, our primary plastic supplier for bezels/consoles, and develop a process to reclaim and re-use the returned bezels/consoles.  This would be a two-step initiative.  The first step would entail developing a process with the base resin suppliers to take the returned bezels, regrind and add necessary stabilizers, etc to develop a final resin compound which meets EMC and the suppliers processing and mechanical specifications.  The second step would entail completing UL testing and certification on the recycled compound.
If this idea is to move forward it will have many measurable successes for EMC.  First is the elimination of a waste stream on the consoles and bezels.  EMC could move to a model in which we are closed loop recovering and reusing all waste on this product
