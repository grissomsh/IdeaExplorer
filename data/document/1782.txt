Each stair step will have a sensor attached where it will detect the movement and then lights a small light for each stair while someone is moving.

This system can be controlled through a computer where it can be automatically initiated if we want to reduce energy consumption or left on when consumption is moderate.
Implementation of idea will save energy and help towards having smart city.
