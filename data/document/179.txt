Diversity
The idea encourages that everyone touches the diversity as it's not applied as it should be.
I came up with this idea as i am seeing that there is a number of very qualified women employees that can fit the position of a supervisor or a manager and they couldn't have this chance even for one time in the history of the department.
Start to hire women that can fit in the posistion and give the chance to the existing qualified women who already work in the addressed departement to be promoted to be either supervisors or managers. 
It would benefit the company as it will complete the concept of the diversity that the company is trying to achieve and will satisfy the employees that are already feeling disturbed or dissatisfied in their department and moving to other departments that fully apply that concept.
