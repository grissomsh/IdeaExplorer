Hyper^2 Converged Platform
Instantly catapult EMC into leadership position in the hyper converged arena by creating a Hyper Converged “Platform as a Service” with Cloud Foundry
We got to this idea during a discussion regarding CF and data protection services needed to support it. We realized that EMC knows best how to sell boxes and we can use that as leverage to capture the PaaS market and then sell additional VAS on top of that.
For some reason hyper converged concepts stopped at converged infrastructure. We suggest to get ahead of the pack by creating preinstalled scale out Cloud Foundry clusters. Cloud Foundry is already built to scale out. We use existing VSpex Blue or VCE hardware and load it with a preconfigured Cloud Foundry instance. We add functionality to automatically configure new clusters to join and create a scale out solution. To really have an edge add ViPR object store or an open source one like Cassandra and deployment scripts to deploy Oracle or postgres or similar DBs. This provides an affordable fully hyper converged platform as a service for enterprise and cloud providers.
We expect EMC to be able to ship a full product relatively quickly. Built correctly it will both be a stable platform for 3rd platform applications and a vantage point to sell more EMC value added services.
