Spark for EMC!
An IT contemporary workplace needs the relevant tools to be contemporary. When I am at home I browse Facebook, Twitter and other apps for my daily fix of random information.
EMC should provide a similar experience in a work context.
When I come to work I HAVE to use a laptop and convoluted tools to do my day-to-day work. 
I wish I could use EMC apps like I do when I am at home using twitter, facebook etc.
Websites, Email with static stale content are old technology. Mobile apps are the way I want to work
