Storing user profile on mobile to be used during out-of-band authentication on websites

Some half year back me and my colleague (Abhilash) were working to build prototype of an idea in which mobile is used to authenticate user to a website. During our discussion we thought of creating a profile on the mobile that can be used at the time of authentication. Narendra and Kiran were part of the discussions and their valuable inputs helped us refine the idea.
How it works:

•	User tries to access protected resource from his device 
•	User gets a securid page which contains space to enter username and user enters username and submits 
•	Server generates a random number creates a QR code which contains username, random number and serverURL(ip) 
•	User gets a page/window which contains QR code and authenticate button 
•	User scans the QR code using the mobile authenticator and generates the token code using softtoken software in mobile 
•	The softtoken software reads the user profile stored in the mobile. This profile has editable fields that the user can set based on his preference
•	The softtoken software sends the profile information, token, random number , location artifacts to server through an encrypted channel
•	Then user clicks "authenticate¨ button on the other device 
•	Server sends success / failure depending on the request from mobile authenticator to this new request.

Advantage of New Approach:
 
The user profile will give the user the flexibility to set specific properties for authentication session based on his need. Like if a user sets cookie-timeout in his profile to 10 mins then the user session will be valid for 10 mins once the user is authenticated.
The user profile can have different settings for different websites. Like a website the user wants to increase the cookie timeout value he can do that. At the same time other websites can use the default profile settings.
