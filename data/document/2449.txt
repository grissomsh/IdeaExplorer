EMC Requirements to Products Translator
EMC has a lot of great products, each product has its own web site and is suitable for a specific deployment consideration. From the customer perspective it is difficult to keep up with all these updates, a customers is looking only for the suitable produ
The most important cycle  in selling a product is the sales and pre-sales cycle. I have seen that this cycle usually takes up alot of time to be completed, and thus came the idea of the requirements to product translator, with the sole purpose of reducing the "time to sell". 
My Solution is to implement a tool from which the customer can enter all his requirements and get the recommended products for deployment as an output. Instead of having to wait for a sales representative to come and explain the product portfolio, the translator can help the customer immediately get an idea about what products is required. The translator can make use of EMC existing tools such as the support matrix to ensure the compatibility of the products with each other.  
By using the requirements to products translator, the time to sell a product can be greatly reduced and the sales effort can be reduced to minimum, allowing the sales force to sell more with less.
