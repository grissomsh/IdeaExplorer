EMC Networker as OVA[Open Virtualization Format] for VMware infrastructure Data protection 

While working with customer on EMC Networker with VBA implementation, I personally felt both can be integrate as OVA bundle
EMC Networker will be preinstalled on OVA bundle and this will also act as VBA proxy to perform a VMware-Image level backups.
OVA bundle will have two options to select 
1. Networker Server with VBA
2. Networker Storage node with VBA

1. Networker Server with VBA
    This can be a primary Networker server and protect the local VMware backups which are associated with one Vcenter infrastructure.
2. Networker Storage node with VBA
    This option would be implemented on other Vcenter infrastructure at the same or different location to perform a backup of respective VM's and will get integrate/configure with primary Networker server.

By implementation this solution we can minimize the resource requirements such as
1. No need to get a dedicated OS license for Networker application to install. 
2. Not required to allocation separate memory & CPUs for Networker server and VBA 
3. Can be used to configure other physical serverâ€™s backups on same environment.
