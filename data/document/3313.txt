School innovative giveaways


I was watching the video that kept playing on the screen in the premises about secure browsing. Gave me the idea that changing words to songs can make information sink in.


As grownups we get attracted to diagrams and would like to make sense to them. We also get attracted to music just like teenagers. What if we do a video like the ones we do in EMC relating to the cloud computing, big data and all the third platform areas. Using songs they relate to would grab their attention. With this we could have puzzles fun to play and make keeping key words on the different pieces. This will grab their attention and might make them want to research the technology more to find out other information about it.
