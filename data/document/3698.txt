Multiple SR resolution tab

As I am from chat support, we usually come accross several customer requesting for update on SR's that are already opened and with different team.
Few being worked, few with out reponse. And to avaoid this scenerio I always wanted a option of a multiple SR resolution tab be created in the Moxie which will directly alert the MOD to get a engineer from the concerned team contact the customer.
There should be a tab implemeted were if the customer comes up with a chat requesting an update on the a SR which is already being worked with a different team or next level of support, we have a tab created in the moxie where the SR number can be entered and that can send out the MOD to take approprite action.
