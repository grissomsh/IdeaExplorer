Leadership live on all EMC iCOE TVs
This is to improve collaboration and communication at work which let people feel connected 
Got this idea during some event and thought if every one in other floors can also see. 
To have call open which display leadership live in all TV's. assume Sarv wants to convey some message regarding innovation , so we can get him live at lunch hour and he can talk with people . people can post question on lync and he is answering in real time . This can be also used as live display of any event happening inside EMC 
This will improve communication and Fun.
