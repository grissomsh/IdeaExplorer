Situational Awareness Application for Customer Service

I have been working with the developers of this GINA technology for several years looking for applications where EMC and GINA technology could be employed.  Many times the industry and internal drive to make everything about "Big Data" as the only way to solve integration and interoperability has become a barrier to looking at this technology.  Additionally, some of the concepts of this unique technology are a bit abstract but very powerful.   One only has to look at the complexity and criticality of how and where this technology is deployed (e.g. DoD WarFighter, Search and Rescue, HealthCare) suggests this is a mature and useful technology.
The Global Information Network Architecture (GINA) is an environment that use an entirely new approach to: 1) Optimizing the use of existing systems; 2) Providing extensions to those systems; 3) Presenting information to other systems and users from existing systems; 4) Maximizing the reuse of existing data and systems, and even; 5) Creating new uses and systems that interoperate seamlessly with existing
environments.  GINA utilizes a System of Systems executable data modeling of systems, device interfaces, applications as objects.  To configure the environment application a designer builds the interoperability information object model with relationships to those models and then is provided access to those systems.  While some of the concepts of this technology are abstract, the technology requires no coding and has an excellent history of being deployed in the most complex environments in rapid time.  As an additional benefit, this technology runs in several Virtual Machines and could be deployed in a VCE or VSPEX design.  While the GINA technology does not require big data technology, it can utilize big data systems or data lakes to enhance the application interoperability for enhancing situational awareness.
