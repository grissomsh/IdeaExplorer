Skills Development @ Federation Scale

The idea came from observing some of the different activities across the campus in the Ireland COE and identifying this as a way to drive Federation thinking and skills development at a larger scale.
The objective of this idea is to introduce skills development & problem solving to a focused group of employees.
The group will consist of members with cross-functional, diverse expertise, designed to foster collaboration and innovation. Members should be from:
•	Different BU’s within the Ireland COE
•	Different COE’s across EMEA (Egypt, Russia & Israel)
•	Different Federation Members (VMware, Pivotal & RSA)
There would be a business challenge presented to the group and they would work together to identify possible solutions, create a submission and present back to the sponsors. A new challenge and new team could be rolled out every quarter.
The benefits are that people will have a real way to interact with others across the COE’s and Federation partners, while developing the skills they will need to be successful. This will help to strengthen the mindset and culture we need to be successful as an organisation in the 3rd Platform. It will build a collaborative, knowledge sharing, problem solving, innovative and results driven culture – all of this @ Federation scale.
