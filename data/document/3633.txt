EMC department view

We are dealing with many employees and communicate in sessions , trainings and fun days and we do not know these employees belong to which department and whom they are working with.

Just log in to our people view page and to add a search option by department then this will state all the employees under this department and it could be appear with a picture like a family tree with the positions, this will help EMcers to know more about other departments and if they want to be directed to a certain person for some reasons and it could also mention if they have any position for hiring
