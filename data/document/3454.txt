 “BaaS” - Big Data Analytics-as-a-Service powered by EMC for startups.

 The idea came up while I was discussion with some startup owners (friends of mine) their challenges and started to think where the answers lie in EMC portfolio

The idea works as follows : 

-	EMC will have a centralized powerful Big Data Analytics infrastructure that will serve the globe
-	The customer will request this service through a web-portal for ease of management
-	The customer will submit his Data Analysis project (what he/she wants to analyze/detect about the data.
-	The central engine will start collecting the data (from different sources or provided by the customer) to EMC Isilon scalable storage
-	The engine will start and run the analytics using the powerful GreenPlum platform.
-	The results will be combined and a detailed report will be submitted to the customer using the web-portal
-	Charges will apply per projects offering low cost and Opex Vs capex

An example of the application of this BaaS approach is fully demonstrated in this referenced Idea I submitted to the same challenge : “EMC Business Locator and Analyzer for startups”
