EMC Special Educational Package for Students

I am so much interested in Educations and facilitating classes for youth students, and I guess this helps the community from many perspectives. I participated in EMC Egypt COE in one of the programs, where we educated some middle school students on how to improve their skills and serve the community better. I enjoyed it a lot, but then it stopped. I though of starting a new program with a big education scope.
The idea should start with forming a Community Education board from EMC volunteers who have experience and knowledge in such field. Then the needed topics should be identified, curriculum should be developed and then agreements with schools and universities all around the world should take place to facilitate classes for students. The topics should include for example:
1- Overview of EMC's products and services
2- Business Etiquette
3- Organizational Behaviour
4- Communication skills and Advanced communication skills
5- Profiling techniques and tests (such as DISC)
6- Presentation skills and Advanced presentation skills
7- Time Management
... etc.
