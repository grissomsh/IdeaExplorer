Suburbs
Community Involvement Challenge the idea is to involve everyone in uploading pics of different Suburbs surrounding him/her location and create these suburbs in 3D so that everyone can see them in reality, understand & submit solution ideas 
I came with the idea today in a brainstorming meeting with my team
it'll create a 3D picture of reality and make people more involved in others needs and problems and to provide solutions for the different problems faced in such areas
it will help employees and the company to be more involved in community activities
