 “Reply All Notifier” – save employees’ time

 The idea came up when we saw some incidents in which reply all to large distribution lists caused some issues and huge waste of time


The idea is to equip the outlook with a notify function linked to the “reply all” button to allow the user to be alerted that his messages will be sent to all.

This notifier can be enabled or disabled by the user depending on his preference.
