Brainstorming Session/ influenced by modern corporate movements towards employee motivation, comfort and fostering creativity 
"HotDesking" offers an ability to take your work with you to "HotSpots" area. An online system is put in place where employees choose what time it suits them to take their work to a new place. Hotspots would be positioned around the three campuses here in Ireland creating greater inter-connectivity inside the Federation. The system will randomly mix people to offer diversity and ability for new "connections" to be made.
The desks would be designed in a way that all the desks are connected fostering collaboration. King Arthur's Round table served as an inspiration.
If the idea was to be successfully implemented, people would be able to break from their routine, get inspired and motivated from working in a new environment. Networking and being introduced to new departments of the Federation in addition to improved communication would be considered as benefits
