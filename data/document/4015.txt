Improvisation of the transport system

We face this issue daily when we leave from work at the end of the shift and this causes not only a lot of inconvenience to the employees but also to the transport supervisor who needs to handle a lot of a employees with the route number and cab number at the same time.
There are a lot of employees leaving to the basement to avail the cab at the same time and this causes a lot of confusion when we look up for the route number displayed on a single board.At times there are more than 100 employees doing the same shift and this causes a lot of confusion when we look up for the route number.
The transport department must send us an sms message or an e-mail with the details of the cab (cab driver phone number or the car plate number) and route number, so that we are aware of the route number may be 30 mins in advance before the end of shift.
