EMC Solutions to Banks

I used to work for a bank that uses the old archiving way to store data
EMC to provide solutions to banks that still use the old archiving way to store their data. 

This solutions could be for example: Centera.

EMC could use big data analytics to know what banks still use the old archiving way in saving data, as some banks especially in the developing countries still use it.
