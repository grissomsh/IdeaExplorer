Employee Retention

This idea has been accumulative slowly in my mind for a while, took outline in a discussion with an ex colleague of mine.
•	Attract, retain and motivate top talent with flexible, workflow-driven talent management
•	Align individual goals with corporate goals with clear visibility into how each employee contributes to the success of the organization
•	Drive a strategic, end-to-end talent management strategy with a single, integrated system for all talent-related activities.
