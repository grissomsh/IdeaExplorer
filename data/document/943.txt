Integrated troubleshoot tool for VNX/VNXe
N/A
We are working on VNX/VNXe, sometimes meet the scenario that the array is in abnormal mode, need much time to troubleshoot.
1. Like health check tasks, create tasks to do common checks, e.g. network, core dumps, boot process, key components
2. Obtain the failure symptoms, the commands sequences before issue, environmental information, collect and analyze the necessary logs, give the summarize, e.g. which step the error occurred in.

Currently, there may be many auto triage tools, we can integrate these tools first.
