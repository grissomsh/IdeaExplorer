Virtualized data layer for IoT
Two challenges deal specifically with IoT and the ability to apply to leverage big data technologies and data science to enhance EMC’s offerings: The Egypt COE Smart City and IoT Challenge & the Israel CoE challenge (Big data and data science solutions to enhance EMC products)
As part of a Hackathon done in Israel
The ideas is to provide a layer within the FBDL that virtualizes the data, meaning no matter from where the data comes, or in what format it is we enable the customer, or the application to access it seamlessly and in a uniform manner. The solution will enable the customer with a “plugNplay” capability to plug in any IoT data he wants. Behind the scenes the solution will have support to the leading IoT protocols, equipped with intelligent machine learning technologies, supported by crowd sourcing capabilities, to identify what type of data comes from each device and deliver it the user in an abstracted and normalized manner. For example, if “one thing” provides temperature data in Celsius and “another thing” in Fahrenheit the solution will identify the high similarity of entropy between these two and offer them in the virtualized layer simply as temperature (C/F according to customer desire).
The solution is essentially another layer in the BDL, sitting under cloud foundry, which will speed up application development, and reduce customer burden in incorporation Iot data.

The successful implementation will provide a seamless virtualized data layer within the FDBL, meaning out offering will come with backed in IoT support that the customers just needs to select what IoT data he wants, and the rest is baked in. This capability is essential when coming to apply data science on all the data in the BDL, and hence we believe that a percentage of the market offering advanced analytics with IoT data can be attributed to this idea. Assuming we are talking about only 5% of the general IoT products and service market ($359B by 2020) hence we are looking at a $18B market by 2020 for this layer.
