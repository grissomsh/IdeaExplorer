Seat sharing with Ease

I have made my cubical in the same way (headless desktop). If the setup remains the same in another cubical, I am roam free. 
To initially promote, we need to attract with FHD monitors, etc.
Traditional Desktop is made head less, (No Monitor, mouse, keyboard)
The seat sharing cubicals are standardized with 2 FHD monitors(Connected to the Docking station), Docking station(DS), Keyboard, Mouse. 
The Employee comes and connects the laptop to DS and uses the 2 monitor in Extend mode. Calls RDP of the headless desktop machine and works normally.
Green concept as the monitors will sleep automatically once the Laptop is removed from docking station. (Saves power)
