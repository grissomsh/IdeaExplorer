'Mayday' Button Remote Support

Redefining EMC and IT’s customer support practice into a modern support service will foster trust, minimize frustration, and make EMC a great place to work and do business.  
Amazon has reported that as of June 2014, 75% of customer contacts for Amazon’s Fire HDX tablet are initiated via their “Mayday Button” Service  with an average response time of just 9.75 seconds. Amazons customers have embraced this feature, saying:

    •	“Un-freaking-believable”
    •	“The Mayday feature of my new kindle is fantastic. To have a person who can hear your voice answer your questions immediately, and solve your issue within seconds is just invaluable.”
    •	“MAYDAY is officially the coolest!!!”
    •	“… It’s everything you said it would be. Mayday is terrific.”
    •	“The Mayday feature ROCKS! I’ve used it twice already and both times the tech support was just the best! Amazon you have the best device support on the market today!”

With this investment into customer service, EMC can leverage technology to facilitate a real world human experience and embrace the future of Online Support.

Once users grant access, EMC Support Techs would be able to control or draw on the device’s screen in order to walk a user through the fix. 
This ability could be included at the desktop level as a windows widget or launched from internal sites such as infinIT or Inside EMC, and added to the mobile app container. 
Additionally, through contemporary communication and engagement methods, this support is likely to produce a greater feeling of trust and overall satisfaction of the services rendered. These methods would include:

   1.	One-sided video conferencing – User can see Support Tech.
   2.	Two-way audio
   3.	Screen / device control and drawing

This service can be initially provided internally through IT support as a beta release, and rolled out externally as refined.
