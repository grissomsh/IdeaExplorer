SIG Layout Automation
For E2E Horizon, and as a post implementation task, getting a layout of the VMAX is essential as a Quality proof and documentation for the configuration applied on the VMAX. Other Tools can give such visibility like SymShot, yet a SIG layout that fits into the standard and commonly used templates is more helpful in documentation than SymShot .xml
The idea initially emerged with a customer that required regular Layout updates, and the automation by an Excel Macro saved a lot of time, yet it depended on files generated by SymShot, and though the Macro is stable and already being used, it's even better to remove it's dependency on SymShot. SIG layout automation is already part of the current running tool "SIG Automation Tool" @ https://inside.emc.com/docs/DOC-122839
Developing an Excel Macro that generates SIG layout from symapi_db.bin and *.aclx that can fit into the SIG template commonly used by SA and IS in Symmetrix projects. Which will be error free, generated within seconds. Also it can be integrated into wider reporting tools for E2E Horizon.
The SIG layout can be a stand alone tool for Symmetrix Customer requiring visibility on their VMAX, or SA working on a design. And it could also be incorporated in wider reporting tool. It's a documentation of the implemented VMAX configuration and saves a lot of manual labor performed by IS.
