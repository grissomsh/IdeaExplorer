Appreciation/Award transparency
we can actually have a dashboard within the teams . Where in we can have a winner weekly or monthly basis , based n a event, positive behavior/attitude, in fluent on team initiative. The example could be an engineer working on critical escalation efficiently handled it & saved the day This gets recognized by another engineer he/she recognized that engineer. The award can be E-card, Thank You Card, CFA. 
We have a major doing on R&R when it comes to overall employee satisfaction. There has several program run & tweaked to make R&R better to some extent it has worked but the idea here is to empower the employees to recognize each other & get inspired. The end result that we can look forward is more transparency & better & healthy work environment.
