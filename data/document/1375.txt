Car Network
Trying to minimize the time taken while staying in yiur car trying to reach your destination
As the streets in Egypt are very crowded in a way that it is hard to tell the amount of time taken between 2 points, this might help in predicting the crowd and trying to avoid it. It is similar to "Bey2ollak" however it is more accurate as people sharing the same roads will be on a network so each will be able to know the frequency of the moving cars and might predict the "crowd to be" as you can see the frequency of the cars and being familiar to that road (if it is your way to work/home), you can tell if the street will get narrower or if there are U-turns, etc.
Each driver, before leaving, will put on the GPS his starting point and destination. ALl people sharing the same road will be sharing a network, so they can communicate together and check the frequency of the cars in the streets. If it is too crowded, drivers who are yet starting their roads will be notified and can take alternative roads. Even drivers can lead each other through (or share)shortcuts/new roads. Once a driver reaches his destination, he gets off this network
This solution will save the time spent in roads, employees will arrive relaxed and on-time
