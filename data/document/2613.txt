Appoint a Communication Committee from across EMC and Federation sites.
The Ireland COE has an issue that there are multiple locations for the EMC federation, so in order to help get the interrelated issues between the federation sites communicated you need a team responsible for communication.
The idea history started from my own department, The GLO department in Egypt COE, there was several members chosen to form a communication team responsible for several duties including communication the problems currently faced and help come up with a solution in a collective effort.
The solution will be to vote/pick a representative or two from each federation or site to be responsible for communicating with onsite employees and the issues or updates from each federation and address the interrelated issues between each and come out with a plan to address the situation in hand.
The level of satisfaction will definitely increase significantly and will help marginalize the distance problem currently faced by the EMC federartions and will help facilitate the problem solving process across the federations.
