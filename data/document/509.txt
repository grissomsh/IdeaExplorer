EMC Products for Visually Challenged
EMC has multiple products, but none of it have voice recognition feature for implementation or management for it - so none of visually challenged person can neither implement nor manage it without support of other person with sites.
I am part of Diversity and Inclusion part at EMC COE and we have very limited employability options for Visual Challenged, so thought to check under this category - is it possible to involve this feature or not?
Kindly enable voice recognition for all the possible EMC Products. I am not the product developer, so we have to work with product development for feasibility checks.
1.) More employment opportunities for Visually Challenged
2.) EMC will be first such company to introduce such feature with its product
