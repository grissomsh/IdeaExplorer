Routine Job rotations with other teams

Came up with the idea when I was working with the customer which involved other products and had to reach out to another resource within CSS to work on the issue. This resulted in delays in providing a resolution to the customer
If there are more number of cases related to another product.
There should be a system in place where in there should be job rotation where in an engineer would buddy up with another SME engineer to work on his cases for 2 weeks or more. 
We do not have a job rotation program at the moment in CSS.
Job rotation would result in knowledge transfer and the development of individual employees, to advance the employees career options and to avoid job boredom.
This would result in employee satisfaction.
There should be a set of criteria to nominate an engineer for job rotation with another team-
It should be mandatory for an engineer to do a certification on the product before he is eligible for a job rotation to another team.
This will enable him to understand and grasp things quickly and will make the job of the SME easier to train him with the product.
This should limit to just one engineer on a quarterly basis so this should not affect the productivity of the team.
