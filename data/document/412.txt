"Workplace Socialization"
HR Challenge-Diversity and Innovation at a Great Place to Work
I recently came up with this idea but this is based on my practical experience while working with one of the companies.
I recently joined EMC and felt that workplace socialization needs to be little more.

Idea is to arrange monthly or quarterly "Get Together, Socializing Events" in the office campus (Cafeteria etc) during working hours with the help of the HR/facility.
These events will be open for all the employees.

Examples : We can invite DJ and let employees hit the floor, can arrange Karaoke, Musical events, arrange fun games etc.
We can call it as “Happy Hours”.

It is unique and different as it's open for all the employees and not just focused on specific team.
Implementation of this idea will improves productivity
Will keep Employees Happy and Healthy. 
Employee Retention
Will creates positive Goodwill of the company.
Helps new hires get up-to-speed faster
Employees will get more recognition
