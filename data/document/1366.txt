"Social Media Ruler"
This app will leverage structured/unstructured data and produces deep analysis for customers insights
2015 TCE Challenge
The solution is to have "Social Media Ruler" an application that collects all EMC related content, analyses, and produces relevant statistical reports.

The app will work on three steps/phases:
1- Information Gathering
2- Data Analysis
3- statistical reporting

The app will be gathering information from the different social media channels where customers left feedback to be put in a database engine that has all the information (i.e per month), and then the data analysis will start based on the predefined parameters to end up and produce a report that entails (not limited to) the following -if available-:
- Experience details (i.e remote upgrade, on site service, remote breakfix,...)
- Product
- Customer name
- Customer district
- Overall experience

Then the data will go through the process of history search.
By allowing the app to access the service center database, we can simply get the associated Service Request by checking the customer history and most recent activities.

Different categories can be set to maximize the output efficiency.


This app will work as a data factory for customer insights on social media channels
