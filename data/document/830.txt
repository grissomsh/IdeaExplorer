EMC Juniors
Working Mums can be a little hesitant on where to leave their children during their wroking hours and how to check on them, and to not leave early everyday to get their children from the nursery and go home. By that way they become less productive at work.

Mums will focus more at work if their juniors are in an above floor, thus being more productive
If a nursery was on premises, it would make it more easy for working mums to exrt more effort at work and will have more excuses to be able to take care of their child or get them from another nursery and have to go home.
