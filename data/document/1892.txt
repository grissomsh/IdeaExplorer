TCE - Simplified VPlex Configuration
This proposal is related to TCE, as it speaks about Simplified Vplex Configuration. 

This might also lead to be a enhancement in today's existing framework.


Work Experience
Solution: 

Automate the complete EZ setup procedure such as right from the "Configure system-setup" command. 
As a first step,All the customer has to do is: 

Flash the SMS on management server and NDU pre-config upgrade.
Post this everything has to be automated. There has to be a communication between SMS1 and SMS2 so that their IPs are fetched by these SMS's during the configuration procedure. 
Auto-configure the cluster [See if there is another SMS, tied up to this network, if yes determine it as Metro else Local].
Auto-configure the meta-volume, enable all the required ports, etc., 
Auto-cnfigure the WAN details based on the dummynet connected to the system. Finally, join the clusters automatically. 

Reduce the time spent in configuring the system. 

Enhanced mode to configure the system via Automatic Mode. No user presence is required. Less prone to errors.
