CKD and FICON support for VPLEX and FTS

When we discovered VPLEX already supports the abstraction of logical volumes on iSCSI disk defined to Linux OS running on z/VM, we theorized a logical next step would extend the same support to z/OS.  The applicability of FTS to the mainframe market is even more straightforward, as many shops already store their data across multiple vendor platforms and this is a way for EMC to gradually take the lead in these enterprises. 
By extending the front-end abstraction layer of VPLEX, and the back-end abstraction layer of FTS, intelligent software enables cross-platform and cross-vendor sharing of mainframe and open systems data regardless of hardware platform. (1) Extending FICON support to VPLEX streamlines cross-platform access to data. For example, an enterprise using z/OS DB2 as a Big Data store may run periodic analytics against specific DB2 tablespaces.  The ETL process of that data may involve lengthy data transfer via the TCP/IP stack, the granting of SAF (security Access facility) privileges, or both. A VPLEX configuration which supports CKD and FICON allows the mainframe host(s) to migrate a volume, a group of volumes, a temporary volume, or a subset of a volume, whether on the same array or across arrays, to target volumes mounted on open system hosts, and do so quickly and non-disruptively, regardless of array type or vendor. A secondary benefoit of this application would be the non-disruptive migration of mainframe volumes from one array to another, whether spin-down or steady-state, without incurring mainframe CPU cycles. (2) extending FICON/CKD support to FTS enhances customers' flexibility in managing their storage, allows for a less urgent migration period, and provides additional benefit for customers' investment. From a competitive standpoint it gives EMC additional leverage when multiple vendors are involved.
