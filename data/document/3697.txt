Buspool from Boston

The idea has been percolating for many years as many of our young working professionals have endured the hardships of the so-called “reverse commute” from the city on a daily basis.  We have conducted brief informal polls amongst our colleagues and they have echoed our sentiment and we feel this would resonate extremely well with the Boston area employees we have yet to poll.  This is the year we turn the issue into action and make our commute a much more efficient and energy-conscious initiative!
The “Buspool” takes a page right out of San Francisco and Silicon Valley’s commute solution by providing buses for Boston area employees looking to commute to EMC/RSA locations.  It would run on a standard schedule (Depart BOS: 6am, 7am, 8am: Depart EMC/RSA: 4pm, 5pm, 6pm, etc) and pick up at standard stops (south station, back bay, allston/brighton, 176, 171, RSA, etc.).  There would be a route for each location (EMC, RSA, Franklin) and we would cover the buses with EMC advertising to generate brand awareness while driving to and from the city.
