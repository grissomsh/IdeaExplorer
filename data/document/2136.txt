YouPreserve
Our submission directly addresses the Community Involvement Team’s need for a cultural crowdsourcing application for digital preservation ideas. Our idea includes a Mock Up application, IT implementation plan, and an internal communication plan for the launch of the application. 
The idea for YouPreserve was a direct result of Steve Todd’s passion and experience with the JFK Library digital archive in his home state of Massachusetts. In addition, Becky Todd recognized the importance of implementing a communication plan so that EMC employees would download and use the application. To tie everything together, Dina and Wissam Halabi relied on their experience within EMC IT to propose a state of the art implementation plan for the application. Together, we have created YouPreserve. 
The YouPreserve application is designed to collect employee digitalization ideas to help preserve their most rare, historical, and precious cultural artifacts. Not only that, but the YouPreserve app builds off of the pre-existing and successful internal YouDefine brand campaign at EMC, which values the diversity of it’s employees. This application is unique because it not only crowdsources digitalization ideas, but also augments the YouDefine campaign. YouDefine already paints a rich picture of our global employees at EMC, YouPreserve enhances this by representing our employee’s cultural treasures. With the ability to upload photos, use multiple languages, and it’s compatibility with iOS and Android environments, the YouPreserve app is the ideal choice for digital preservation at EMC. 

Please reference our important attachment on Inside EMC that shows the mock up, implementation plan, and communication plan: https://inside.emc.com/docs/DOC-154822

If our idea were implemented, hundreds of EMC employees worldwide would be downloading the YouPreserve app and submitting photos of their local cultural treasures. Through this process, the Community Involvement team would have a wide variety of projects to consider funding. Our EMC brand would become more powerful with the success of this application. The You Define branding hanging in the halls of EMC would now include photos of employees side by side with their historical cultural treasures.
