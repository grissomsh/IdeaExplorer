Energising mindsets
My idea is to reduce stress level and energise people so that they don't need unhealthy things to get energized at workplace. For example people prefer too much caffeine, smoking, soda etc to be energised
People around take more breaks from work to relax or get energized. With music we can control of this and improve employee health at the same time.
Play music in the pantry area to make them feel relaxed and energized.  This will not only help them improve their health by not having too much of caffeine/smoking but also allow them to work efficiently. 
Less sick leaves, less short breaks, more productivity, more satisfied
