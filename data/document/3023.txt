EMC Digital ID
The challenge with the IT Contemporary workplace is to help use Sobo as an innovation space to test out new ideas to improve our workplace.  This idea would help eliminate the need for physical badges within EMC by leveraging EMC Managed Phones
The idea came up when I decided to place my EMC ID inside my phone case, getting rid of the need to carry my badge on my waist.  This has been extremely convenient when navigating the hallways, and allowed me not have to worry about forgetting it.
Leveraging NFC on support phones to replace a physical badge with an app.  This will behave similar to the RSA token, except will allow users to badge through doors using NFC technology. This can also tie into the Big Data Lake initiative and cross-reference users entering buildings with their seamless access logons to improve security posture within EMC IT.  The data can be used to verify the users presence at a specific office, before allowing them to logon using cert-based auth. This will also allow users to not need to carry their badge around wherever they go, making it more convenient and secure to navigate the workplace.  This is also an overall security improvement for EMC Security and EMC IT.
I would like to see the idea rolled out as an option for devices that support it and are managed by EMC IT, which will ultimately improve customer experience and efficiency.  I think it would be great to tie it into the IT Data Lake initiative in order to
