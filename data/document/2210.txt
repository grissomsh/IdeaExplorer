Solution Support Program 
Use Business Resources across all Business Units to drive continuous knowledge sharing and raise employees cross-products awareness to enhance the Total Customer Experience.

Better collaboration and information-sharing across our remote business units. 

This will improve the supportability of those cross-product solutions within 12 Months or less.

3- IDP:
- Management assign TSE for SOS Group based on requirements and career-path.
- TSE will ONLY enroll in the relevant topics of his pre-assigned SOS.
- Program owner Follow-up Skill progress with TSEs and update Management Team.
