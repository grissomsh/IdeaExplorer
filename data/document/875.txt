Continuous Data Protection - CDP for virtual machines. 
Near to zero downtime of virtual machines (e.g. VMware vCenter server). This will make sure the virtual machine (basic building block of cloud technology) remains available 24x7 using continuously protected virtual machine files with ready to restore backup available.
I was thinking of this idea for past 6 months, but now I can relate the importance of this idea in automatic backup, recovery and making 24x7 availability of VMs in cloud technology.
Protect virtual machines (e.g. VMware vCenter server) using a soft appliance and based on "Continuous Data Protection snapshotting technology" for the changed blocked for virtual machines files. Also perform indexing of changed blocked of virtual machine data disks and it's configuration files to construct the restore point for full virtual machine image automatically if requested else for manual restore. 
This is at design level, needs more brainstorming, to come to final design and implementation. If the implementation will be part of some virtualization technology suite then we can capture the market for backup & recovery of virtual machines in real time, to make virtual machine online 27x7.
