MetaVolume Snapshot
N/A
Prior work experince
Proposed Solution : Keeping the snapshot of the metavolume in the local setup
===============================================================================

1. Take the snapshot of the metavol when the system is optimal
2. Copy the metadata snapshot in to your local setup
3. When the system is in unrecoverable state, reset the system and import this metadata snapshot to restore all the soft-configuration

Conditions : This script might work only when all the hardware's (like initiators, BE arrays, SV's and Vplex directors) are remain same
