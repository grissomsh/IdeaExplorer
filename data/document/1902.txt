migrate data between different file and block hardware type
As viper can support heterogeneous hardware like VNX ,ISILON,NetAPP, Datadomain,etc. There should be a tool to  move file and block data in between different hardware venders. If a client has hardware different venders. They can inject them in viper and based on the rules engines, data can be moved to different hardware. 
Also if the data is old it can move from vmax to data domain for LTDR which can save money for clients.
