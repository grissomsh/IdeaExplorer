Egypt COE's Fitness Program 
This aims at the 2 challenges chosen below. They say that a healthy mind resides in a healthy body. 
A lot of employees have been talking about this and how we do not find the time to finish work, get home then get to the gym. Some days it's impossible with all the traffic so having something at EMC would be brilliant!! 

Most multinationals have this; example in Egypt is Samsung 
Create a fitness program on EMC premisses that employees can enroll in. We already have fitness classes that take place every Monday but these are random classes and do not serve any purpose. 

we should have a complete program (such as insanity for example) that starts after the main shift at EMC so employees can attend after work and then leave. 

Saves time!!
Creates a healthy environment > stress relief (and much more benefits) 
We can have competitions. 
More healthy employees and more devoted and loyal. This will boost performance.
