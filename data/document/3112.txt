Using another voice-over-IP system to link between conference rooms
N/A
History is simple: i'm tired of unsuccessful tries to decipher all the noise on other side of cord.
I could say that using TeamSpeak VoIP stations could be nice solution. I don't know about business apps, but TeamSpeak really proved itself with in-games communication. However it's often used with headset, it has simple built-in solutions to improve audio from any source. Another VoIP system could also be found and tested... just throw away the thing you're using for phone meetings.
Using the new and tested VoIP system would greatly improve the information flow at the meetings, therefore pulling up the efficiency of teamwork.
