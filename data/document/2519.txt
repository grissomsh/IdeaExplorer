Keep the strength in Support
The idea is simple. Great minds and talents be the most efficient, if they can just work and bring in their ideas; attitude and behavior. 
The idea grow over the last few years. A while ago, the most important thing was, to solve issues and make customers happy. Today, we play only the numbers game. TTFR; NCC; perfect time reporting.... they are important, but give TSEs the trust to do the best for our company and our customers, would deliver better results than this BIG BROTHER mentality we currently see. Another point is staffing. We might have enough FTEs, but compared to competitors, we hire young and inexperienced people and only provide poor training (mainly elearnings without proper hands-on and the chance to ask questions). Competitors hire experienced people or use the classic instructor led; hands on training for beginners.
Don't try to put a number on everything. Don't see the need to document every single second of their worktime. Don't put so much effort in "teaching" how to report work time, put this efforts into the development of useful, automatic tools.
If the above points get changed, it will lead to a higher employee satisfaction, higher motivation, better service, happier customers, higher TCE, differentiates our Support/Service even more from the competitors, more selling (products on the market pret
