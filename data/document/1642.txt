Customers products Family Tree
it can provide revenue opportunity to the business
I attended a workshop in the COE that discussed this challenge
I suggest a new process to register the product as follows:
- when a customer purchase a product and the factory is ready to ship it, the factory to produce a birth certificate for the product with the customer name and location. it should then be added to customer's product family tree. the family tree to have three main branches: EMC II, VMware, Pivotal. EMC II branch to have three sub branches: CTD, ETD, solution. the new product to be located correctly in the tree.
if all customers have the product family tree, it will help in new sales. using business analytics, we can run report on a tree or group of trees to identify a proposed new product that can give the customer a solution based on what he already has. if sales intend to sell a certain product, they can consult the tree app to check if it's a good step or it could have a conflict with an existing product. it can also recommend some configuration to better match with the existing products
