To create the Competence Centre of OSS (Open Source Software) inside RCOE
The solution will allow to find out ways to improve productivity and efficiency for every EMC BU/project by participating in OSI.
Idea was generated by participating in the brainstorming session organized by RCOE. After that it was discussed with the session participants and it was decided to promote it.
Currently there is the group of enthusiasts interested in developing the initiative. The group is titled 'RCoE OSS Competence Centre'.
The centre has its own e-mail list.
New 'RCoE OSS Competence Centre' open group is created on inside.emc.com: https://inside.emc.com/groups/rcoe-competence-centre-for-oss
The resource is filled with relevant information.
The group meetings held.
The Competence Centre of OSS consolidates employees interested in the developing of collaboration between EMC and OSI. They will work on a number of tasks, including:
-	to gather an information about OSI (what it is, its goals, OSS specific, licensing, usage, contribution, OSS vs proprietary SW);
-	to consult BU management/employees about ways to develop OSS;
-	to be a medium between BU management/employees and EMC CTO related OSS activities;
-	to deliver workshops for employees;
-	to find out ways to get benefits ( profit, EMC technologies popularization, to make EMC  technologies as a standard in some OSS areas,  EMC OSS products  ecosystem formation and so on â€¦) for the company by participating in OSS community;
The Competence Centre of OSS is created. It consolidates the enthusiasts of OSS.
The Centre activities bring additional value for the company, i.e.:
- BU/projects are informed how to collaborate with OSI;
- BU/projects are proposed how to increase its effectiveness;
- there is an approach developed to encourage people to contribute to OSS;
- workshops and meetings with skilled people are organized;
- the communication between the Centre and Legal and Open Source Strategy Team (OSST) is established.
