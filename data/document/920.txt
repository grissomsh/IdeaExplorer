Proxy Profiling
Our idea results in high availability & business priority Internet and by reducing the Internet downtime and related incidents
This idea came in as part of our discussion after the Internet slowness caused by Cricket world cup streaming.
The idea is to monitor the IronPort group utilizations and if it goes above 85% the IronPort group should activate a new profile which has restricted bandwidth for the segments like Entertainments, cricket, politics etc. and prioritize the business traffic segments. 
With this idea implementation we can improve the availability of business resources, reduced number of Internet incidents and downtime.
