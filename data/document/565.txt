Controlling road traffic using data storage, archiving, networking and Data Analytic
This idea corresponds to Egypt COE Smart City and IoT Challenge, where we will use data storage, archiving, networking and Data Analytic to solve commuting problems.
This idea came to me while I was stuck in a traffic signal for quite long, while the road was completely empty in the other direction.
Traffic signals should have cameras and image processors. The processor will distinguish the presence and absence of vehicles in road images and signal the traffic light to go red if the road is empty while continuing free flow in other direction for a longer period. The cameras will take pictures in a particular interval and switch signals once there are cars again on the empty road.
This idea once implemented will require huge storage space to store and process the images. Big data analysis can be implemented to determine the need for flyovers or underpasses for heavy congestion areas. We can implement back up and archiving solution to the processed images and later use the archived data for analysis. Networking will be used to  transfer the images. We can use multiple EMC products and it will be of huge benefit for the company as every city is looking for a smarter solution to heavy traffic.
