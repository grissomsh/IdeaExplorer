Integrate Screenshot Capturing for Error Handling
The idea is to integrate common behaviour to troubleshoot customers’ issues for ECD products.
The idea came up on Captiva brainstorming session.
“Screenshot Button” on exception screen can solve this problem – if something unusual happened, customer can press the special button and screenshot will be automatically saved to the special folder. 
The Button can be available from any screen, not only from screens with exceptions.
The functionality of this button can be extended by additional functions for DLL listing and for System Information (.nfo file).
“Screenshot Button” can be added to any module or screen in any ECD product.
This solution will save a lot of time (and as a result, money):
- It is easy to make screenshot in 1 click
- Additional information about the issue is saved; sometimes it will be enough for starting investigation, as a result, the customer will take answer/resolution earlier
- If issue is hardly reproducible, it is not necessary to reproduce the issue again immediately
As a result, the customer is happy, support is happy, engineering is happy.
