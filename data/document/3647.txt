Employee Green Revolving Loan Fund 

A variation rooted in the concept of an internal green revolving loan fund which Kathrin Winkler and Michael Norbeck have both been thinking of. After a green revolving loan fund was mentioned on a call with Laura Nelson, Michael Norbeck and Frances Douglas, Laura suggested working in the concept of microloans into this process by opening it up EMC employees and funding more, smaller projects in the local communities. 
EMC would create a revolving loan fund for employees for use in financing the upfront costs associated with home energy efficiency improvements. Loans would range from $2,000-$10,000. The most common projects will likely be household upgrades to new, energy efficient refrigerators, freezers, hot water heaters, and washer/dryer sets. A loan could also be used for projects like installing energy-efficient windows, proper levels of insulation, solar water heaters, or solar panel installations (partial assistance). The loans repayments entered back into the fund to be used for a future loan. 
As a way to increase employee engagement and education around energy production, recipients of the loans would be use Sustineo to update the EMC community on the process of implementing their project and (via a private Sustineo page) to track their monthly energy consumption for twelve months.
