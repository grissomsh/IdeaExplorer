stolen car tracking 

i stolen twice and reported this to the police and they can't find the thief simply because they have no evidence. 
we can make a GPS bug or something with sim card to communicate the location of the car, and send alerts to a mobile via SMS or mobile app with silents noise to make the thief more comfortable and make it easy to the governments to catch him.
