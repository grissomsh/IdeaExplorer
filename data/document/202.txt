Elevator sensors to be activated during Rush hours
This idea will optimize the usage of Elevators during peek hour.
Eliminate the redundant stops of the elevator when it is completely full.
My solution is a sensor in the elevator that detects the maximum acceptable weight  that don't let the elevators stops in the floors when its completely full.
Optimized Elevator usage.
