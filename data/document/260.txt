Authentication method based on userâ€™s safe-zone, set by sensors

o	Sensors from smart home provide intelligent data that, when taken together, can determine with confidence whether the homeowner is at home. This allows the creation of a safe-zone, so that when the user is home, there is a lower risk of fraud.
o	Inputs:
?	Lights
?	Air conditioning
?	Motion sensor
?	Ambient noise
?	Door activity
Allows users to not have to login so long as sensors indicate that the space is safe. This can be implemented at a person's or employee's residence, at an employee's office, or anywhere else.
