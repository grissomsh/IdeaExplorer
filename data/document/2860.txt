SRM frontend database wrong configuration leads to down time of Web Application.
SRM frontend database configuration requires editing xml files to edit the database details which in turn requires the apache tomcat server to restart and this leads to a down time for SRM Web Application where the users are impacted until the database co
While working on the installation of SRM and ViPR, I have come across the problem which led to web application interface down when i have accidentally applied User privileges for the apg user in MySQL that have been improperly configured, preventing the SRM Front End from connecting to the databases.
After editing the files conf\server.xml,conf\Catalina\localhost\APG.xml and conf\Catalina\localhost\APG-WS.xml with the database details we need to restart the frontend i.e. Apache tomcat. During the restart activity the Apache tomcat server tries to establish the database connectivity enabling the database modules in the httpd.conf file on the apache server and display the output in the Web Application. After editing the xml files, saving and restarting the frontend there should be an intermediate option to test the database connectivity with the frontend and display an error message stating that the connectivity could not be established and providing an opportunity for the administrator to edit the xml files and correct the details. 
The user or the administrator would get a chance to identify the error and update the privileges correctly so that the installation would continue smoothly leading to a perfect installation which will in turn lead to a successful configuration.
