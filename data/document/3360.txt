More training to New Hire and Campus Hire

This idea came to me when I reviewed the passed 3 years in EMC; New Hire and Campus Hire are affected by implementation of this idea.
EMC need give more training of products to New Hire and Campus Hire; this should include: (Take VNX for example) how VNX connects with front end app server and how they work with each other; For VNX components, how DataMover/SP/Control Station connect to each other and how they work with each other.
Thus trainees can get basic understanding of the whole architecture, which will bring convenience to their daily job.
