Extent Size on Vmax Array 

While while working in a project this is what i learned from the customer who had worked multiple arrays.
On Third Party Vendor Like HP 3PAR thin technology uses the much smaller increment of 16KB, which results in less wastage, particularly with fragmented and thin-hostile file systems
