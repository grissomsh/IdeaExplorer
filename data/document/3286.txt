Plant a Tree!

I saw some people taking trees off that are on the streets and I was very sad about it and I was thinking of something to help that. 
We can collect money monthly and go buy 2-3 trees and go plant them somewhere. It could be somewhere nearby or any other place, according to where the people decide. This will help our environment and make it a better place.
