Vipr SRM(W4N) Event/Alert Life-Cycle Dashboard
It helps SDS predictive maintenance by creating useful "time series data" from alert/event "state transformations." Improves TCE by helping system administrators. Reports like re- occurrence of events can be used for modeling predictive analysis.
This idea came while exploring ways to use the data from alert and events for further use.

1. Create a time-series data for alert/event state transformations and different analysis reports for System Administrators. This will be stored in BigData object Store.

2. Use big data analytics to create objects to event to time mapping.

3. Create a map between config change and event resolution based on object identity and connections.

4. Create automation stubs based on event type, device type and solution .

5. Create set of historical solutions for each events . Set of different configurations done.

6. Allow admins to automate solutions based on even occurrence.

Examples for  Alert Life-Cycle Dashboard
1. Alert/Event Resolution time statistics
e.g. Average time take for alerts to reach resolved state from new state.

2.Alert/Event Lifecycle Report
e.g. The time “Vcenter has reached critical capacity alert” has stayed in new , acknowledged,assigned,resolved states .
e.g. Average time between assigned and resolved state for an alert.

3.Average time in a state Report
e.g. Average time for alerts in assigned state. 

4.Alert/Event Reoccurrence statistics
e.g. How many times in a day vcenter has reached critical capacity

5.Alert Re-Notification based on threshold for time it stayed in unassigned state.

If implemented it will improve,
1.Customer satisfaction.
2.Reduce time to resolve issues.
3.Plan future course of actions.
4.Data for machine learning.
