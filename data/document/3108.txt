Bangalore ground water heat map

First thought about it from the Innovation roadmap 2014
The solution I propose is to come up with a water heat-map of available ground water resource. The way it works is
1. Adding a IP/GSM enabled sensors to the water pump that pumps water from these water tables. These will measure couple of things
a. The Water Pressure
b. The depth of the water table in the region
2. Transmit this data to the central server.
3. The server provides a real time heat map of the region based on the above metrics.
