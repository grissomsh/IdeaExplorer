Using XtremIO cluster for virtualized Hadoop systems installed on ESXi.
This can be seen an use case of XtremIO for virtual HDFS nodes and big data environments.This will also provide flash storage access for big data extensions.
This idea was contemplated while reading the Deployment of Virtualized Hadoop Systems
with VMware vSphere Big Data Extensions.
When using vSphere for virtualized Hadoop, we can leverage the XtremIO cluster using iSCSI ports to connect to existing IP infrastructure.To store the data for these Hadoop scale-out nodes virtual machines, a shared-storage mechanism can be provided by XtremIO.
Hadoop MapReduce function can work together with XtremIO de-duplication and compression features to provide efficient data processing along with high IOPS. With the iSCSI ports, we can utilize the exiting 10Gig network.

The success factor of this idea would be the integration of XtremIO and VMware for Hadoop, bigdata and data analytics.This can be sold as a viable solution for Hadoop on flash storage.
