The Talent Store
My idea match the sponsor challene as it is all about utilizing the resources we have as corporate, with such huge amount of human resources and talents how can we utilize them in the development of all areas and utilize them in grabbing the new right resources to be added to EMC
the idea first came to me that when i was being recrutied i tried to show during the interviews all the skills i aquired during various experinces i gained in university specialy soft skills, but what i noticed that the competenices needed for the position was the only thing that needed to be documented for the recruiters at this moment as for the skills they just considered it was god i have them but without noticing how they can utilize me for having these skills, but then after a few month i tried to start showing these skills and people were surprised that me and others have this knowldge or this particlar skill and they started pushing us to utilize them in many activites.
My solution is devided into 3 fazes :
1- the manual collection: 
during the interviews attention should be kept to every single details the interview mentions about himslef from experiences, skills and background and a all should be documented,using inside EMC profiles, employes should fill in all the experiences, skills and competencies in they have in all fields and should be taged using key words, proactivly from employees and sall be monitored and evaluated by the managers, and should be updated frequently
2- deep analysis should be done al these skills and available in form of search engine, to be able to idenfity the skills available and extract the data needed whena certain skill is needed for any reason.
3- utilize the output of the analysis in pointing out the skills missing the human force, and after doing a market reasearch regarding the pools to recruit from, the cucle starts from the begining during the interview to select the missing or needed backgrounds and skills.

note: by skills and background i include everthing from hobbies to proffessional technical and non technical skills as i am a food lover, so the first thing while looking at the challenge i searched for anything that i can give input in regarding food industry and market or how technology can help it.
It is a process that might take some time untill we start seeing big results, but each phase would have its own KPIs then we would know we are on the right track, but the real success would be when the number of participants in all acitivties in EMC specially the innovation challenge increase and the quality of the ideas elevate due to assiging the right talents with various backgorunds each providing his input and synergise and when the recruitment process stops being only about recruiting competencies but recruiting talents so the variety increases and reach the goal.
