My office! SMART Office!
In our journey to Great place to work, addressing "contemporary workplace" challenge Suggesting this Idea to Smart define our EMC campus and give near to state of the art facility.
I found it difficult to Book or locate  a Training or conference room is . that is when I thought this kind of navigation application within a campus can be so cool.
Smart phone Application designed to cater the needs of booking conference room based on a simple search available conference room criteria by giving required specifications and 
second part of the application would be GPS tracking  entire EMC campus, which lets any individual find Conference rooms, Managers cabin's just like any other navigation App
Time spent in searching available conference room can be reduced.
Implementing this gives every employee a sense of working in a SMART Connected Campus
