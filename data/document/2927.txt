Instant Delivery of Extra Storage Capacity
This idea addresses Office of the CTO 'New Business' Challenge.  The idea is to offer Storage As A Service to a customer who places a hardware order until the order is delivered and installed.
I work in the manufacturing test space and one of the challenges we face is the demand to test and deploy hardware as soon as it is ordered.  We are driving multiple initiatives in this space such as ‘Test in A Day’ but the test cycle time is still not short enough for us to be able to instantaneously deliver to customers’ requirements.  By leveraging our cloud capabilities we can alleviate test and delivery lead times and give hardware customers a soft introduction to the third platform. 
This solution solves a lead time problem for our customers. At present the customer has to describe their requirements and work with our solutions and sales teams to configure a system that best meets their requirements. The order then has to be processed, the material sourced, the system configured, tested, shipped and installed.  With my proposal once the customer has describes how much storage they require we could offer them an interim solution of Storage As A Service until their physical hardware arrives.
The success and benefits of this proposal would be measured in increased sales as it provides a competitive advantage. It also drives a symbiotic relationship with customers as our businesses evolve to the third platform.
