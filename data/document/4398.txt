Cloud storage accelerator which can bring hot data to host memory

From working with VDI/EUC with different storage platform, I realize that leverage host memory to speed up storage read IO, even write IO, is much affordable and cost effective comparing to do it inside storage box. 
To make the transition to cloud environment, this idea introduce a 'Cloud Storage Accelerator' component sitting on each physical host/hypervisor to bring tranditional SAN to cloud playbook. It works as below:

The 'Cloud storage accelerator' exists as a component of PowerPath in virtualized environment like VMware or Hyper-V. It provides features:
1 Monitor activies to LUNs
2 Use assigned memory as read cache
3 Do some inline-dedup function to reduce network transfer bandwidth consumption
4 Work with SP FAST technology to read data into memory before storming comes.For example, read the master image of VDI to memory before windows boot storm.
5.Writes are deduplated and write to storage with efficiency.
6.Leverage local SSD as write persistent protection. Write reachs componement memory and SSD and directly return ACK to application. 

This idea can leverage server memory to accelerate the read IO, and enhance EMC's VNX/VMAX supporting much more scale than ever.
