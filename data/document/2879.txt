Sky Bridge or Escalator facility for Cafeteria at India COE (Bangalore)
We have two buildings which are named as A and B block, each building has cafeteria at terrace (8th and 9th floor respectively), every day need to spend lot of time in traveling one building to another to find the good food for the day, if we do not find 
I got this idea when i was went for a dinner at A block where i work, then I realized there is no good food, however compromised rather than traveling all the way to an another building which takes more time and energy. 
I suggest, we should have a sky bridge or Escalator to travel from A block to B Block cafes or vice versa.
It will benefit the company for the contribution towards GREAT place to work, Employee satisfaction, time saving for individual and organizational level, help in reducing traffic jam for the elevators specially at peak hours,
