Diversity and Innovation at a Great Place to Work
This idea propose the model on how we at EMC, ensure that we are getting diversity of thinking and ideas as we continue to innovate.
I have been managing projects since few years.  I also got opportunity leading diverse team of multiple delivery center cross country for a customer project while working with my prior employer. During forming team, and resolving customer problems and project delivery, I observed that a diverse team from different country and diversity in team make it a great work place and help growing innovative solution to serve better. 
1. The innovative performance of both individuals and teams would be increased by more gender balance at the team level. Diversity in the workplace allows companies to select the best available talent. Maintain gender balance during recruitment or talent acquisition in the organization across all business units and all geography. 
2. Encourage people of diverse gender, experience, ethnic and geography to form collaborative groups/community of SMEs (Subject Matter Experts). Leaderships define groups based on the industries or functional or cross-functional verticals.   
3. Inspire all to share thoughts, imaginations, and diverse experience to solve any specific problem encountered or pitch in any innovative idea from self or crowdsourced.  
4. Advocate growing the surfaced thoughts through open and collaborative discussion across the diverse talent group to mature the result as 'Solution'.
 
Innovation of ideas comes from peers, and diversity of team increase the engagement and collaboration to draw innovation. To succeed in 3rd platform soft skills eg communication and knowing how to build and manage relationships is highly important.
