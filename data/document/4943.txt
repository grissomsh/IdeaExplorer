Array Wokshop 

Innovation Session
There should be a Workshop lab course for all employees during their first months in order to get to know what each array looks like in real life and take a look at the disks and have a basic knowledge of the technicalities of the array (ex. remove or install drives). Most of us have worked in EMC for over 2 years and do not even know what VNXs or Symmetrixes look like.
