RSA  - 3 Factor Authentication for credit card payments

Recently when I returned from holidays I found that my credit card was used in another country so I started thinkign about possible solutions
In this digital era how can we protect ourselves against credit card fraud, according to Consumer Sentinel Network, U.S. Department of Justice up to 10% of Americas have fallen victim to credit card fraud. The global estimate for credit card fraud is over $5.5B. We are all familiar with RSA’s approach to securing access to networks via two factor authentication, something you have (Fob) and something you know (PIN). We take a similar approach with credit cards, you have a physical card and a security pin number, the problem with this solution is that the credit card number is static and doesn’t change every 30 secs similar to a fob. There are two potential solutions that we could explore with RSA  - 1) Securid/Visa/AMEX Card, which generates dynamic credit card numbers  or 2) 3 Factor Authentication which would also confirm your transaction by referencing the location of your smart phone, something you have (your credit card) and your secure pin number, if the transaction is taking place in another country but your smart phone is not showing in the same region then it requires additional authorization.
