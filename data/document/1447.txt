Energy saving Champions :: You're In Charge!
Make this as an competition where BU or COEs or floor level can compete for contribution towards environmental stewardship
Very few team member involve in go green/power saving/ enery saving/eco connect kind of initiatives - its always left to same set of people year on year. This will help involve the entire team
The competition should be on monthly basis between BUs or floor or COE level - the team to minimize the resources utilization will emerge as winners. For instance each team can adopt the following to minimize power/energy saving
- Switching off monitors
- Switch off lights during lunch hours/all hands ,etc.
- WFH once a week : office shutdown
- Powering off lab servers by individual engineer/team level after office hours or weekends
- Minimizing printing as much as possible :: number of pages printed could be one factor to win the competition

There should be live feed to monitor the savings which should be displayed and have  more participation in the competition. Based on the saving, a part of the saving should be given as prize to the winner
Save enery!!
