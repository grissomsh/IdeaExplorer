Effective & Sustained Collaboration Across Global Services

This idea came during conversation with peers and senior executives.
The authors of this idea strongly felt the need to enable connection
and links between technical and not technical communities
through building a data architecture model from sources such as
inside.emc.com and OBIEE and other social media feeds. Please
take a look at the data architecture and the underlying
technology that solves this problem. It essentially links
people more effectively. The linking of people is done through
employee circles and its associated chapters in different 
geographies. It was done in constant consultation
with Chief Diversity Officer and her team. The diversity and inclusion
aspect can foster new communities because the participants
will feel a sense of purpose and belonging. 

For example, the authors are planning to start an open source
community based on XML for  EMSD storage arrays. We hope
such contribution will encourage others across geographies
to contribute. It will help customer facing staff and also
help us deliver many of service offerings effectively. Here is the link to

Similar non-technical communities can be created and 
sustained using the technology described above.

We can measure the success of such communities using
qualitative and quantitative metrics across the following:
# of collaboration projects - number of participants
# of open source projects - number of participants
# of EMCU students participated
# of CSR projects - number of participants
# of Partners involved.

The authors have built some of the building blocks already
and it can be used to build a quick prototype in a
short span of time. A sample interface is provided to get look and feel
when application goes live.
