It improves the operation recovery and minimizes the data loss situation in product environmen
The idea came up during the brainstorming session on how to save RPO on AppSync and avoid any manual intervention if any backup copy failed.

Storage infrastructure, service plan completion, health and activity of service plans,  events/alerts metrics specific RPO failures are collected using AppSync solution pack
This provide visibility on the health and activity of Application specific service plans
ViPR SRM do an analysis on an Event/alert based on RPO miss on AppSync and triggers an action to AppSync to generate a backup copy and proactively saves RPO.
