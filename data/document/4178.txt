Dashboard (Features, ARs, tasks, immportant announcement) for dailywork for every developers/Manager

Everyday I need to handle various kinds of tasks, sometime important items may be ignored. And it's time consuming to check all the status in different system. So I want to a single central application to get all the information.
A simple web based application could provide such service to aggregate information from different sources and present it to users within EMC. User can pick up whatever he is interested in to his customized dashboard, then he can easily get all the information he care about from a single application. Followings are what I think useful to me and my team, but now they exist in different system and need to open them one by one to read.
