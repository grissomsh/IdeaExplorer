Fun portal

I got this Idea as I'm in MOF (Ministry of Fun) community and would like to communicate the activities we do and also interact with other COE who have such Fun Committee within their organisation and would share their creative thoughts with us.
1. We can share our monthly fun activites on this portal with pictures and videos
2. we can share our creative ideas across COEs. 
3. we connect culturally as we can share about the Family day and Annual day we conduct
