Customize your own office
In HR challenge we need a more diverse work space, we can achieve that by taking the input of every single employee, his/her ideas in his/her own cube, we are not neglecting their preference but also we are using them.
Google started this idea long time ago, for that Google is one of the Greatest places to work at.
My solution is to let every employee customize his/her own office/cube, so there is no longer specific colour or design for all offices or cubes, but every employee can design his/her own, so they can choose the colour they want, the shape within the same space given to them earlier.
We are going a further mile towards making EMC The best place to work at, We are trying to make our company is another comfort zone for each one of us, and at the same time, we used each and everyone's idea in the company, we never neglected someone's preference.
