EMC Customer Data House "ECDH"

I came up with this idea when i saw the Greenplum slogan "Data In. Decisions Out" and when i managed to generate sales opportunities even if I’m not a sales guy.
Every single piece of information generated by anyone in EMC is a treasure.
I see a huge difference when i call a customer knowing almost everything about him and when i call him having just an idea..
The idea is to build a data warehouse using the EMC great product "Greenplum" to store our ALL customer's related information in one place, not only storing but analyzing..
This web base tool will be directly connected to all EMC customer's meeting points (mentioned above) and not only but also can be accesses by EMCers for manual inputs.
Think about a hidden white board placed in the customer site and everyone from EMC who enters the site knows immediately about the previous work done by any other engineer, issues faced, new sales orders, etc..
