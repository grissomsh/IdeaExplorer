Do you have Federated-IQ account? - (Employee collaboration & solutions platform)

This idea is been drafted & published after a 3.5 hours of brain storming session with EMC product support professionals, Technical SME's & available TAM members.
We can show you a demo on this application stack if required!
Basically, a new application stack (Called as "FederatedIQ") should be built for this requirement. This application stack will connect to EMC, VMware, RSA & Pivotal communities for better information & awareness of technical problems faced by customers/sales/partners, status on solutions delivery, innovative methods for better improvements in existing process.

How this works in real-time?
    o How does the FEDERATED-IQ work for both individuals, SSZ, Domain Experts & Customers?

Customer Issues, Requirements, Product Enhancements will be pooled togther & will be published with the help of "MASTER-DB" to SSZ Individuals, Domain Experts, Technical Account Managers, Community Bloggers on unsolved issues, complex problems & automation oriented solutions. This helps the pooled professionals to display or demonstrate skills in a wide range of cloud computing, big data, network, storage, pivotal topics. Teams can work together to help each other complete individual tasks.

    o How does the FEDERATED-IQ helps further?

Task Organization - Our idea will be much easier to navigate the hundreds of tasks available with a “sort-by” option on the main Task tab. Customers, TAM, Bloggers can choose the task view from three different (EMC, VMware, Pivotal) organizational views. This view will be saved in preferences if anybody leave the page, so he or she will always be able to come back to it. If somebody would like to change organizational view, simply need to choose a different option.

    o What does the FEDERATED-IQ leverage to further?

Our solution empowers EMC by bringing the power of software to communications. It integrates telephony, voice, web conferencing, presence, and instant messaging into one seamless experience. Meanwhile, this proposal extends the Lync software platform with revolutionary EMC applications that meet an expanding variety of business, social, mobile and communications needs. This app stack will send proactive notifications of available solutions to all elite customers by RSS Feeds, Texting, Twitter hash tags, etc.


    o Does FEDERATED-IQ leverage REMOTE CONNECTIVITY or Dail Home features?

Experts get additional information, logs, product versions, exact issues & action already taken in place to solve customer problem. FederatedIQ will leverage/collect/review the machine data generated by ESRS (remote connectivity) applications built by all EVP organizations. By leveraging automatic log analysis technologies, fixing the problem or reduction in RCA can be done to a great extent.
