Intergrate Jenkins and Docker
N/A
Come up with the idea when I am studying docker technical.
Use a docker host to dynamically provision a slave.

Use docker container as slave. Use "docker plugin" to connect.  It will automatically close the container after the execution is performed. 

No need to do much changes in Jenkins Build Script.

With Docker, it will be possible to run each test in a new dedicated environment. It will permits use to avoid problems of collision and ensure consistence between the environments.
