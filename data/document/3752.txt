To have a portal where EMC employees can view the Enhancement Request status of a product

We have been asked by many customers that they have submitted ER for the product feature, however they cannot track it or no updates received later on the same.
Currently whenever customer submits a ER, a request ID is generated. However neither he or EMC Support can view the status on the ER/ know what happened next. A portal internally with status updated, will give support access to know and share the status with customers when they request.
