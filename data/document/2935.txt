Optimizing vCenter with RecoverPoint Orchestration Proxy (ROP)
1.	APJ Challenge
The proposed appliance lowers the customer TCO of the RecoverPoint for VMs solution, by supporting many tenants from one vCenter. It improves Customer Experience, by empowering Service Providers to offer DR to many tenants, from one vCent
The well-known limitation presented itself as a customer problem in discussions with some Tier 2 SPs serving smaller enterprises. Cost effectiveness and architectural design dictated a single vCenter to serve all these customers. Architecture design has been discussed, and some initial development evaluation was performed.  
The proposed proxy appliance (ROP) interfaces many RecoverPoint for VM clusters, allowing them to open connections to the ROP, instead of to the vCenter. An initial RecoverPoint Virtual Appliance (vRPA) cluster request is sent to the vCenter, to retrieve the full inventory tree. This request is transparently forwarded to the vCenter. In the current implementation, vRPAs poll the vCenter for updates, using a particular method. The vCenter returns the list of updates since the previous request. In the proposed solution, the ROP keeps all the VC updates in memory for a given period of time. The vRPA cluster requests updates from the ROP, instead of from the vCenter. If a given update no longer exists in the ROP, the request will be sent to the vCenter. This solution results in reduction of load on the vCenter, and lowers the number of open connections to the vCenter. 
If developed, ROP would increase the number of tenants a SP could serve on a single vCenter, positioning RecoverPoint as a viable choice. Currently, RecoverPoint certification states scale to 4-8 per vCenter; success would be the proven, certified scale t
