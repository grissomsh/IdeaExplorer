EMC ladies Club
As the challenge is addressing diversity, and as technology field is male dominant.
my idea will address females working in EMC in different countries and different departments.

actually there is already a club in Egypt COE called " Bees club" for ladies it is established in 2014 before I joined EMC and it is very successful and always encourage EMC ladies to keep the passion of work and innovate. so I have the idea to make it global

My idea will support females working , engage all females in EMC worldwide to have a common target, purpose and activities.
supporting them to innovate and proof they are doing a huge role in society.
They could support any cause worldwide and have a finger print in every country under the umbrella of EMC.
They could have an annual meeting and elections.
This will encourage them to do better and believe in themselves and their effect.

this will enhance productivity , encourage ladies to success and have success stories to share
