Work while you Workout.

I came up with the Idea when I visited US at my Clients location and Employees productivity is awesome by giving them few facilities to modify and make them feel comfortable and feel like to work their way the way they would like to. Also maintaining the decorm of the Office.
EMC should arrange more regularly Blood Donation Camps / Marathons / similar activities on Quaterly/Half Yearly Basis.

Health is one of the major concern/challenge for people in IT.
Employees should be given freedom to have their workstations modified according to their needs of workout (raised work stations / ergonomic charis / head rest and so on). 
Understanding the GYM being available for the workout. However, an Employee can keep the Treadmill at workstation (may be self funded) and they can workout while they are working.

Also the Fun Facilities that is provided in the Campus should be reviewed regulary to keep it always in good condition.
