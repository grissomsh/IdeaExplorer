Training App
Changing the culture of training within EMC.
We (Neil Burns, Eoin Hegarty and Colm O'Leary) brainstormed this idea as part of a training initiative we worked on with David Moore.
Training and development is of utmost importance in EMC, both to our day-to-day work and to the future business position of the company in an ever changing technical environment. As such we would like to recommend the creation of a training and development App for mobile devices where access of a subset of the EMC training courses would be available. This would enable employees to train ‘on the go’ and further enhance our training culture. 
 
This would take the form of a downloadable App that is not tied to EMC equipment (no fob key required) with the proviso that the courses available are not sensitive to our business.

Increase uptake in training, improve skillset among employees and help EMC employees become more rounded professionals.
