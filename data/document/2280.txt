Better PaaS patterns using Infrastructure as Code
Provide performance, quality of result and faster time to market for onboarding existing workloads to Hybrid Cloud Platforms. 
Failure to onboard existing workloads proved that the standard approach to define patterns for an existing complex ecosystem has limits and that a better approach to this problem is needed.
Using the reporting facility of the Puppet agent, extended with custom Ruby facts, we can extract a JSON view of the whole infrastructure. This can be programmatically processed to produce an set of patterns appropriate for the existing workloads.
A programmatic approach to pattern definition would be a sharp competitive edge as a consulting tool. It would be a deal closer and would enable faster and better design & delivery, thus optimizing revenue and ensuring customer satisfaction. It would also kickstart the use of Infrastructure as code, thus enabling the clients to move to a modern model with devops, continuous delivery, containers.
