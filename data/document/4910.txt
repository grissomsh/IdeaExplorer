Content management product back up in cloud

Currently there is no backup service for content repository solutions through DPAD current products in the upcoming releases. This would benefit numerous businesses which are dependent on content management solutions.
Provide the backup services to CMA products through DPAD products. The backup solution to host in the cloud service will help the content repository to be available at low cost.
