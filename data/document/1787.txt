Global Employee / Employees Exchange Program 
As the challenge addresses diversity in a work place and making use of it as an advantage for innovation and creativity, this idea will promote more diversity in EMC's work place as well as bridging the gap between COEs in different countries.
I thought that it is like AIESEC global citizen program or the students exchange programs between universities.
The idea is to make an employee exchange program where interested employees sign up for it. The program will allow an employee exchange between different COEs with in the same department. the chosen employees will trade places and work in each others COEs for a week or two during which they would be evaluated upon adaptability, productivity and activities that they have participated in.
This will break any barriers of distance between EMC employees and the best way to experience diversity. 
- Bringing innovation
- Respecting diversity
- Bringing different cultures together.
- One family.
