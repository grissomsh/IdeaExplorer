Collision mitigation system for mfg

I thought of the idea while witnessing the large volumes of pallet trucks and cab movers traversing the mfg. floor.  Idea is at concept phase.
We need to adopt the '2 second rule' of safe driving on roads to the plants. To give the operators of these pallet trucks\cab movers a visual indication of a 'safe' distance, chevrons can be painted at the required spacing on the main corridors around the mfg. floor.  Operators of the trucks and movers would then have a clear indicator to keep a pre-determined number of chevrons between them and the preceding truck.
