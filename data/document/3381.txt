 Adaptive and Predictive Keyboard  Plugin in Outlook and Service Center using Data Analytics

  The idea did come up from my daily work as I use email templates ina manual way. I thought of an adaptive way to do this.
 On daily basis, we write similar emails. We use certain keywords and expressions very often in our emails. The idea is to equip the “outlook” with a plugin that enables data analytics in real time on what I write. 

This plugin will offer adaptive and predictive typing experience depending on what words/sentences I write the most. The Data Analytics association rules will be used to detect what words normally come together?

While typing the predictive keyboard will provide nominations from y most-used words/sentences.

Such approach will enable a huge amount of time and effort as well as money saved for all EMC employees.
