"Call via Deskphone" App for Microsoft Lync (In a single click, call any contact in your Lync, including customers, from your deskphone)
A modern and fun workplace with new and cutting edge ways to communicate and collaborate. Calling all colleagues or clients from Lync without remembering their numbers gives a seamless experience from anywhere with device flexibility and less restrictions.
Got this idea when we were discussing and analyzing on how the communication can be improved using the advanced Microsft Lync.
Workflow:

*Start Lync 2010 Client 
*Go to Tools â€“> Configure Call through Deskphone App
* The following information have to be configured in our App
     # IP Address of our Deskphone
     # Extension number of our Deskphone
     # Passcode of our Deskphone
* On your Contact list in Lync , right click to a contact and select "Call through Desk Phone"

How to configure the "Call through Deskphone" app:
------------------------------------------------------------------
* The SNOM feature in Lync allow us to add a new driver in Lync, which will let us to choose what default Audio device to use for every call that you make from Lync
* So we can configure our Cisco IP phone as the audio device in our Call through DeskPhone App
* We can also switch call between Lync client and our desk phone.
