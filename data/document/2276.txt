INDI: EMC's Innovation Diversity Index
The HR Diversity and Innovation challenge seeks to improve diversity in our innovation processes. EMC has already built a prototype to measure innovation (GINA). Our idea proposes that we extend the work to specifically measure diversity and innovation.
In 2011 an ethnically diverse, global team of men and women got together to discuss measuring global EMC innovation activity. The team built a model for measuring innovation. As this tool has progressed through the years it has been used to try and quantify EMC's investment in research and advanced development.
In 2015 the GINA tool gathered a list of all research and advanced development projects in EMC, along with the names and geographic locations of the technologists. Given executive guidance on the type of diversity statistics desired, this data can be mined and visualized to create the first-ever "Innovation Diversity Index". A full description of the potential solution can be found here: https://inside.emc.com/docs/DOC-154604 
EMC could be the first company in the industry to publish an "innovation diversity index". This index would serve as a baseline benchmark on how diverse our innovation ecosystem is and serve as the impetus for improving the diversity of our innovation teams.
