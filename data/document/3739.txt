Employee Community Club

We say Unity in Diversity, but that really happens in our automated life? it is too less in fact.

In order to bring a change, we must engage periodically and develop individual thoughts through continuous networking.
When several employees connect together, they learn many lessons out of each other or through the group of people.

This is called a Employee meet or Employee Club. This Club/Forum should be available weekly twice, so that active group of people could get engaged and discuss on the happenings.

This Club is not just for a particular team nor limited for a Group/BU in specific, this is about one EMC employees in the particular region (Employee travelling from other regions could also be part), which means all enthusiastic employees could be part of the club, irrespective of the team and Job Profile.

This helps in learning, organizing and addressing common issues, thus leads to sharing knowledge, recent trends in the globe.
