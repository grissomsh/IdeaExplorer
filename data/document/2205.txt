Smart Parking lots for Bikes and Bike Sharing/Renting using Keyless systems
Internet Of Bikes and Internet of Parking lots

Sports awareness and communities have developed rapidly in the last 3 years in Egypt, 
and different groups started to gather and do cycling sports.

Early in the morning I see cycling groups passing by my home,
I thought i would like to join them every now and then but since i do it occasionally why don't I rent a bike.

or maybe buy a bike and rent it during the long period in which my bike is not utilized
My solution consists of 3 parts

1- Mobile/Web App
2- Smart Bike that can connect to the internet to communicate with the app
3- Smart Bike Parking lots 


Smart Parking Logs.

- This is the place where you can park you bike, it must be smart to authenticate Bike owners and other people bike owners share/rent the bike too

- It camera for each slot to send the bike owner a picture for his bike so he can make sure the bike is in good condition (In case of sharing/renting)

- Smart algorithm to determine the condition of the bike


Features for Bike Owners

1- Create an account on the App
2- Add your Bike(s) to your account
3- Bikes are parked at the smart parking lots and kept in a locked position
4- Authenticate yourself from the application to unlock the Bike- Keyless entry (we can get help from RSA)
5- Enjoy the Cycling then park the Bike at the nearest Smart Parking lot
6- Get requests for bike sharing and renting.
7- Receive payments and insurance (Incase of damage/lost Bikes to be returned upon parking the bike and after the parking lot acknowledge that the bike is in good condition) in case of bike renting
8- Track the bike location
9- Get various notifications
10- have access list of people who can use keyless access to the bike
11- Rate the bike renter


Features for Bike Renters
