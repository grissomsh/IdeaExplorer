Web Based Identification of Networker Support for Modules
Ideas will improve the support ability of a CTD product NetWorker

There is no document or support webpage available which gives mapping between Backup product NetWorker Modules and NetWorker versions supported.
E.g:IF customer is running with NMM3.0 if h
While  preparing Test Completion Report for a NMM cumulative release, I was asked by the support manager to include the compatibility table as the support team is facing a huge challenge with compatibility issues seen at the customer end.
       To include this table in my report, I went through various documents and spoke to many people to get the right information.Had to invest so much of time just to include a table which has high importance.I even came across huge mails chains just to know the compatibility of NetWorker with the Modules.
       This lead to this idea of having a webpage where anybody can quickly know about the right combination of NW server/Client with NW Modules.
Below is the solution :

1. Website should be created.
2. 'Select the Module' drop box should be there for the user to select the required module with version
3. 'Select the version of the NW Module' drop box should be there for the user to select the right version of the NW Module.
4. 'Generate report' button should be there which displays a table containing all the NW Server and Client versions  which support the particular version of the NW Module.

Currently we have compatibility guide which is not so clear and also confusing.It does not specifically mention about the NW Server and Client versions.It gives a generic answer for the query which leads to many questions again.

->If my idea is successful,there will be a one stop source for all the Networker Modules to check the Compatibility with Networker server/Client.
->I would call it as success if there were no more calls to the support regarding the Compatibility check.
