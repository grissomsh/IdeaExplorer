Charity Food Boxes

The idea came to me from many years as I always take any extra food that remains from me in the restaurants and give it to any beggar in the street, also any excessive food in my house I put it in a plastic bag and close it well but throw it in the rubbish (as there is no boxes) for the street animals (dogs, cats and birds) then I saw a post on FB that was telling to make a box in front of the apartments’ to put the extra food in it and I liked it. 
EMC can make wooden or metal boxes written on it a slogan beside EMC’s logo. Those boxes can be hanged in front of each restaurant, building, company and even in random streets so that any restaurant, worker, family members or passers in the streets having excessive food can put them inside those boxes and writing on it the date he had put the food in so that any poor person or beggars take it and know the date.
