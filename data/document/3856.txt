Add battery pack to wireless testing rack

Idea developed while entering near contactless and wireless network smart cart ideas.
Adding batteries to a 'smart' test rack would give the ability to power up product where traditionally product would need to have been placed in a dedicated cell and physically powered up.  The batteries would be charged while the product is on test and provide power to the product for a 'short' period of time should some checks be required.
This could be coupled with the wireless network card and near contactless power to give greater flexibility.
Alternatively, larger batteries could be used to test the product, providing a stable power supply, and the mains power ensures that the batteries are charged akin to a hybrid car.
