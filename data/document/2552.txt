Internal developers for internal apps
The possibility to have your own customized apps for your day-to-day workflow will create a more contemporary workplace, where your needs for automation can be met in a shorter time, with greater flexibility and a smaller budget.
My teamâ€™s tools have limited functionalities when it comes to customization. I found myself unable to perform a task due to the unsuitability of our tools. Silvio La Porta offered to develop an HTML app to solve my problem. This reminded us of a system in place in all Google offices, where dedicated engineers create and develop all the internal tools. We then developed this concept to make it as flexible and feasible as possible.
Engineers and developers already employed in EMC could accept requests from other teams to develop new custom apps, answering directly or finding others to create a small team to handle the request, thus encouraging networking and collaboration. The compensation for the engineer who accepts and completes the request can be a voucher or coins that can be cashed in every quarter. This compensation could come out of the requesting teams budget. For development and storage we would initially need one server, even an old machine.
Submission portal similar to Excellence@emc. Manager notification for approval. Area for engineers profiles for co-worker search. The service will save money for new tools: EMC engineers develop the new apps, which in turn optimize many processes.
