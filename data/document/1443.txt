Compared with other enterprise backup software compititors in industry.
Our solution is to produce a report which will contain
>Statistics of job done/clients backed up or restored/size of application etc.
>Graphical representation of backup or restore done which passed/failed
>Color coding for job status like passed/failed/aborted/completed job with errors/killed jobs etc.

>Reporting will be awesome!!
>Enhancement of Reports will improve Total Customer Experience(TCE).
>Can be easily implemented in cycles because reporting is obtained by the data which is already available in the repository.
