Highly efficient and automated Elastic Labs
Our proposed idea contains many small and highly effective solutions which will help to address “Durham Data Center Elastic Labs Challenge”.
Our idea is to create a SDDC solution which includes, OS virtualization, Openstack or VMware vCloud, Software Defined Network (SDN), Virtual SAN, and Software defined Storage (SDS),. 
Our current LAB setup has all these solutions working independently and thought of clubbing all together will make a good solution.
SDS - Software to manage policy-based provisioning and management of data storage independent of hardware. 
SAN – Normal core and SAN switches with be used for connectivity. However, with the help of SDS abstraction and vSAN be introduced. 
Network – Post normal network connectivity, we can use VMware SDN to manage network services through abstraction of lower-level functionality
Automation – Openstack or VMware vCloud can be used for high level automation.
Console Access – add an option in self-service portal where all hosts and array’s console can be accessed.
1. Initial setup will allow individual/basic level automation.
2. This will allow us to reduce Operational Expenditure. 
3. All devices/resources in LAB be managed from single portal.
4. Saves maintenance and support cost.
