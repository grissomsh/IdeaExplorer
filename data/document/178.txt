This idea will ease the process of creating Bridge Call
A part of my job is joining Bride Calls with SAMs , SMEs , Managers or Field Engineers , To ease this process it will better to use the option of Lync Conference Call. 
My idea is to Enable a new Feature in Lync , is that by just creating a Group Conversation by a button Click all of it's Participants can Join a Conference Call.
1-The Ease of creating a Conference Call.
2-Saving the Time to create a bridge Call.
