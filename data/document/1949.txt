Fault Tolerant data services at scale
VMware delivers extremely high availability with VMware/FT, as long as you need 4 or fewer cores.

Build Greenplum on this to deliver database availability, in the cloud, at scales beyond what is otherwise possible in the cloud.
This idea resulted from internal brainstorming around how to compete with the HA strengths of Oracle RAC.
Customers buy Oracle RAC for availability.  VMware FT provides better availability than RAC but is limited to 4 CPU cores.   

Provide fault tolerant availability (best on the market) at scale, in the cloud, by layering Greenplum RDBMS on VMware FT.

Greenplum adapted a Postgres RDBMS for horizontal scale.  Unlike traditional databases that scale up, this scales out.  Take advantage of this to keep the workload per node lower than 4 cores so we can use VMware for fault tolerance.
This elevates PostgreSQL to the highest levels of availability that can be delivered.  We would evolve an existing market (HA database) by taking the high-end of the market.

This would be delivered in cloud environments such as the Federation Enterprise Hybrid Cloud.
