Elastic data center optimization based on Graph models
The idea is aimed to provide automated optimization of a data center based on telemetry data collected within the data center.
The idea was forged in a meeting of the data science as a service team. 
Our idea is comprised of the following stages:
1.	Automatically create the current layout of the data center by using thin and flexible sensors attached to each of the required components
2.	Collect telemetry data from the different elements in the data center. For example: the amount of network traffic between all the components, CPU levels for each application.
3.	Define a cost function to describe the cost of a given layout based on the given telemetry data.
Once we have the above data we can reduce the input into a commonly used data structure in computer science called a graph which is described by a set of nodes, connections between the nodes and, for each connection, a set of weights (i.e., each based on a different telemetry parameter). Given a graph we can solve the following optimization problems:
1.	Find the optimal layout of the data center given the cost function and the telemetry layout
2.	Enable ‘what if’ analysis capabilities based on simulation and semi-supervised approach in which algorithms identify the most appropriate levers to change and investigate the simulated outcome

The success & benefits of the innovation can be measured by reducing the amount of man power needed to plan or transform a data center. In addition the solution can be used to reduce maintenance costs (select which hardware to replace or transit).
