 Collaborate with yourself – a new approach for Solution-support

 The idea came up from a local initiative 


 The idea is as simple as having all skill-sets needed within the support team itself. For example if a support team for VNX is combined of 10 members and the top 5 skill areas that are needed are :

–	Host Consult - Windows
–	Connectivity-Brocade or McData
–	Host Consult - ESX
–	Connectivity-Cisco
–	Host Consult – Linux
We will assign these skill sets to the team members. So for example 2 TSEs will focus on windows host skill set other 3 TSEs will focus on ESXi host skill set .. etc. The TSEs will get training in each skill set assigned and will be assigned a mentor from the Experts in this area as well.  Each TSE will be the reference for his team in this specific skill set when needed.

When it comes to collaboration, the team member will collaborate with the TSE assigned the skill set inside the same team. They will work together for a resolution to the problem. If any further technical assistance is needed, then a collaboration to the next level can be done
