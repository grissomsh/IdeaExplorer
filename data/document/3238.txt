Client to server security

-
In Social media pictures and data are stored and accesible through clients. This is also the case for any client server.
Have RSA use the same code generation it uses in tokens to generate the link and file names. So the client gets a passphrase based on which it will generate codes and sequences identical to the codes generated on the server side.

This way the naming of all pages are dynamically changed based on the passphrase sent from the server to the client at that instance.
