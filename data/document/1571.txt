Set up the limit sample for cosmetic specification
Normally regarding to the product qualification, we just focus on the dimension and process control. For some different surface treatment, we didn't record the limit samples for further judgement for supplier especially for the"NOT EXCESSIVE" lever. 
We got one cosmetic compliant of Megtron last year. As there is no record of the sample, it cost a lot of time to aglin the specificaiton. if there is the sample record from the beginning, it will be easier to provide the good product.
Supplier will be aware of the cosmetic sepcification clear then keep any defect within their own site.
Need supplier to provide the different sample to EMC, then define the limit sample to record and suppler should consolidate the data in the system for further info.
