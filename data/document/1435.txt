Trade FLASH wear for speed
My idea covers use cases for the XtremIO array to offer new capabilities and efficencies to XTremIO end users.
Initially I proposed this idea for VNX FASTVP - to trade speed for FLASH replacement cost.
Provide tunable option for CUSTOMER (end-user) of AFA to get more speed by redirecting more IOs to LE devices at the expense of wearing LE FLASH 
-Possibly faster IO for customers (in case when LE flash is faster than ME FLASH)
-potentially more sales for EMC (as well service sales)
