) Mobile Application with voice recognition

CSAT is not an easy way for the customer to get their feedback.
Create a mobile App that used to get a customer feedback without any survey or any question, the customer will record a voice message with his feedback, and through a voice recognition SW that will get the voice message and make analysis on it to know if the customer is happy or not.
Example: The customer will record a voice message like I am not happy from the service that I got due to the wasted time that happened due to wrong info in the SR opened.
The SW will recognize that this customer is angry, from words (Not Happy, Wasted Time, and Wrong SR)
