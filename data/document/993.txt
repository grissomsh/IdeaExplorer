XCP based Community App
Idea is based on app which gathers details on skills, location etc of EMC employees from Inside EMC  and leverage this for connecting employees and schools nearby . It also provides reporting capability on EMC Gives Back days for Community Involvement. 

This idea came when we were discussing this challenge

There will be three parts of solution.
1. Employee Skill Management: Based on Documentum XCP with visual map on skills. POC has been done by IIG in same.
2. Analytics / Recommendation Engine –Skill management will be integrated with Inside.emc.com where algorithms automatically match the profiles with the opportunities and issue alerts on both sides.
3. Collaboration, Reward & Reporting Service –Utilize ‘Circle ‘collaborative concept from SMILES  , connects LinkedIn ,Twitter , Facebook ,manage schedule and rewards . Provides reporting on the givebacks.
This will also be available via mobile application.

-Save time and money
-Ease of collaboration
- Promotes EMC give back
