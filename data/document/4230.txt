Data Analytics of My Voice Data

This is idea is good and user friendly
Basically we should create a web application containing all the managers as the chart and on click of then we can navigate in internal data. 
Example is there will be authentication for the web Application ,this for security and authorization.
When HR logges in there will be dropm down containing year,on select of the year there will the list of all managers appearing as the Chart.
On click of that chart,we get the internal data of the feedback given by the employees under him.
so it will be easy to read and easy to analyse the data,we can make use of Data  anlaysitcs and Big Data.
