E-Commerce Servers, Stock market servers, Online ticket booking server (IRCTC)
Resources of the servers can be used according to the requirement. To over come the unavailability of the services, for example booking a tatkal railway ticket using IRCTC during the peak time will be like winning a battle.
Always I used to get fail to book a thatkal railway ticket. The web browser never used to open when I start opening the website during peak time(10:00 am IST website is irctc.co.in). Some of the time after doing payment also ticket wont be confirmed.
According to my point of view these E-Commerce Servers, Stock market servers, Online ticket booking server (IRCTC) server uses the high resource utilization during peak time, hence we can configure these server with the cloud so that during peak time excess load should pushed to cloud which means to say server can use the extra RAM, CPU, Hard disk from cloud and once after utilization comes down we can release the cloud resources(ram, hard disk, cpu) Due to which users can easily book the tatkal ticket, browsing the E-commerce website, during the peak time of stock exchange
High utilization of the resources at particular time, hence we can use the cloud resources (CPU,RAM,HARDDISK) during the peak utilization of the server. And these cloud resources can be released once after reeducation in the utilization of the server. Due to this we can bill the customer using the metering basis. We can leverage existing infrastructure hence no need to buy extra CPU,RAM,Storage as we can use the resource from cloud when there is requirement. And we can by pass the electricity, cooling data center, space set up for the same.
