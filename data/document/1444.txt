EMC STEM Drive (100% PoC with video demo)
UTAH COE Challenge: Developed an android APP which lets employees and teachers to collaborate on STEM topics and organize STEM events.
It is our new idea. We already have the experience of developing prototype. We thought, with the knowledge of Android, we could do this. So we had a initial brainstorming to have simple and user-friendly interface which could leverage resources mentioned in the challenge. We redefined our idea as and when required and finally came up with a solution satisfying all needs.
