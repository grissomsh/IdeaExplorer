EMC Certification Material Blog

it happens in universities where students go an ask other students to take their old books.
By creating a blog where we show who got certified in what so if a new hire or an employee wants to get the same certification he won't need to order the same material online he'll just go and ask the employee who get certified if he/she can borrow his material in this way we save money and EMC wont have to pay for extra materials.
