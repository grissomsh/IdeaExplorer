D2 cloud using a NoSql database
1) EMC can own the infrastructure required for the hosting of such deployments for clients.

2) Alternatively, EMC can provide consulting for setting up such a private cloud for other interested clients.
VMware offerings can be integrated in both cases
The current D2 stack is cumbersome and candidate for refactoring considering:
1) Documentum platform is outdated and does not provide any integration with a nosql database. 
2) Data model for D2 seems to be more suited for a nosql repository
3) It should be easier for developers and vendors to create solutions on top of D2 using a schemaless database
4) Faster migration to cloud with new approach
5) With new API, underlying legacy layer can be removed, resulting in overall simplified product to maintain for the clients. 
Re-write the middle layer to store data in a no-sql repository. Move away from current platform layer. Simplify technology stack by using opensource java offerings like MongoDB or Cassandra. Although, one can use a multi-tenant approach with current RDBMS but it would be better if a fresh no-sql approach is taken. One should also strive to stick to single java technology stack end-to-end which would be easier to maintain. Overtime, solutions like lifesciences can also migrate to the cloud as well gradually.   

  
New approach will:
1) Improve client satisfaction as new approach moves to the opex model
2) Enhance productivity since developers will maintain a simpler stack
3) Make money since VMware offerings can be bundled
4) Allow solutions in cloud
