Smart Public Transportation
After applying this solution, we will be able to collect a lot of data about public transportation in Egypt, amount of people using them and the information about routes being used for each of the transportation methods.


A lot of people in Egypt relay on public transportation and it would benefit all of us if the service is enhanced.
By having a sensor in each bus, we will be able to track location and speed.

Data will be sent to a centralized place where software will be analyzing all these information to provide us with graphs and maps.

The amount of data being sent can be used for other ideas as well but this could be the start.

Data can be used as well through making a public mobile application where people can know information about specific bus and ETA of each of them.
Success would be seeing the whole system improved and smart enough to keep up with the increase of traffic in Egypt.
