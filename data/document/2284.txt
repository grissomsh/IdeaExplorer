I follow TedTalks on Twitter. I'd like to keep up to date on business headlines. I watch the Coffee Comms emails. The thought occurred that these updates could be digested perhaps in the canteen, receptions, washrooms elsewhere, thereby improving both productivity, and keeping employees up to date with latest business or plant news. 
I believe their are options for relevant business & development information to digested more easily in the workplace. eg. Why not have TV Screens in washrooms, aisle-ways, Visitor receptions, Office Blocks and or Canteen showing relevant TedTalks, Bloomberg news headlines, Sky business news headlines, Coffee Communications. This would meant that employees could keep informed on interesting news and information, while away from their desks. It would reduce time spent reviewing information at their PC, or at home. It may also make a positive impression on Plant Tours. 
Success would look like all employees discussing the impact of international business headlines, on a daily basis. Discussing interesting TedTalks. Benefits could be increased business acumen, knowledge & engagement among employees. External Visitor perception of a very focused and professional company.
