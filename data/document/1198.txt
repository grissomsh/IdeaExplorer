Data Erasure Data Mining
Common location Data Erasure Logs 
Proof of erasure of Disks
Can be mined to see if the erasure process is breaking down in a particular are or disk type etc.
Can be mined to derive business analytics.
Can be mine to see trends and resource accordingly.
Was asking about mining results and there did not appear to be a easy way of doing this.
Upload the logs from CXClear/VNXClear and 1UClear to Cloud based storage and mine the results - who/where/when and how successful were the erasures. 
Success would be where any authorised person could immediately scan the results for erasures performed in their relevant areas and have available the number of a erasures done, number of disks, disk types and if there are failures why there might be failures and who performed the erasure.
