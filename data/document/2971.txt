Intelligent Converged Hard disk - Bringing Compute Close to Disk
With Convergence Technology in play now, I feel the next step would be to take it further and have X86 and Flash(or HDD) co-exist. This would commoditize storage further and our EMC Storage Products(VNX, VMAX) can linearly scale(true Scale out)
Looking at how Nutanix, changing the landscape. And VSPEX already seems late in the game.
Intelligent Hard drive, which has X86,Flash(or HDD) and Software(ESX,HDFS,ONEFS etc). Expecting the density of the drives will grow in future, this would be a smart move.

These Intelligent Hard drives go into VNX or VMAX, and could become next generation VSPEX that we see today.

These 4 disks can do what Nutanix or Vspex can now!!
Huge.
