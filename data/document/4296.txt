SMART woman

The idea was generated from a GBS Idea Generation Brainstorming session led by Martin O'Flaherty
To attract students in their transition year, we will promote this challenge as a unique opportunity to  get experience in their area of interest in an early stage. 

Let's take 1 month, 4 challenges, 1 week per challenge. (Variable) 

Challenge 1, week 1; The students who are in their transition year, will make a presentation about SMART, career opportunities, branches that are using STEM, how it can be interesting for young woman, in general and what STEM involves and that it is not just for man. Also, they will introduce their pupils how STEM works, and they will give some lessons. 

Challenge 2, week 2; The transition year students, created a challenge for their pupil involving STEM . For example; they have created an app with a bug in it. It is up to the students to solve this problem. 

Challenge 3, week 3; Evaluating of challenge number 2. What was the bug in the app? How did you discover it? How can you make sure this wont happen again? Etc.

Challenge 4, week 4; The pupils will make a presentation about what they would like to do in STEM business and how they would like to progress over the years in high school that are yet to come. How they could see themselves involved in the STEM business.
