Hotdesking with smart cards
The idea is relevant to IT Contemporary Workplace Challenge as it solves a lot convenience problems with hotdeskting with normal Laptop and Desktop machines and the nuisance of relocating the machines from place to place as the number of available desks becomes insufficient.
Being able to relocate from station to station by simply taking the smart card and logging it on the new desk makes it flexible and efficient to swap places while maintaining the machine state as it is.
During my study at the University of Stuttgart during my bachelor project, I saw the setup implemented there in the labs and it was very practical and time saving to use.
The proposed solution is to replace the Laptop/Desktop setup in the workplace with a thin client that connects to the network and monitor , which has a slot for smart cards that can log you on your virtual session by simply putting the smart card in.The hardware required is available and implemented in many places around the world, Sun provides clients for the virtual session access that support password or smart card authentication. The solution eliminates a lot of the space and trouble with managing full built desktop or laptop machines and having to manage the software updates or changing configuration of them. This solution makes it much easier to relocate your workstation without logging off your machine or interrupting any ongoing activities as you simply take your smart card with you that logs you onto the ongoing virtual session.
The main outcome would be to improve the productivity by having non disruptive swapping of machines, will solve the spacing problem and make it much easier to share space with multiple colleagues.Having seamless transitioning of active machines from one place to another saves a lot of time and space as well as having an extremely easy method to share by simply swapping smart cards as opposed to being tied to one location with the Desktop or having to move significant amount of equipment to have the same setup as you had before.
