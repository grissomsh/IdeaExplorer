Innovation 24/7
Innovation is crucial to EMC's success. The company must constantly search for new products, solutions and processes to retain it's competitive advantage and to increase its market share.
The idea came to me after reading a book on the subject recently.
Publish / celebrate / reward innovations more frequently. Run the competition every quarter. Publicise innovations. Have more articles in the company magazine. Have posters on the walls. Have award ceremonies. Idea of the week / month, etc. People can take inspiration from these ideas.
What is best practice? Provide training. Bring in expert speakers. Have forums.
There could be a fun element - an award of the craziest solution to a problem? What about voluntary innovation teams?
This should increase the number and quality of the ideas. More innovators would emerge. There would be culture of constant innovation. It should generate more cost savings and process improvements.
It would help people see beyond the confines of their position / role. It would help to tap this very valuable resource within it's employees.
The latest ideas would be there for all to see and this would provide inspiration for more innovation.
