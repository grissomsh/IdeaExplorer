Implement Application Aware Storage functionality
In today's growing demand from customers, user operations which are application centric rather than storage centric, it is high time to use this feature to address the customer's demand.
Work Experience
The virtualization product must have the intelligence on the underlying storage arrays (Either Flash or traditional SPIN disks). The application aware-storage must understand the concept of VM and hence the application and allowing storage operations like "provisioning", cloning, snapshots, replications to be at application level rather than LUN or volume level.By providing this management granularity, and the flexibility to select an individual or a dynamically defined group of VMs on which to perform storage operations, existing storage resources will be used much more efficiently. The ability to select groups of VMs is important in providing the needed storage support for multitier applications, such as SAP, that run across multiple VMs simultaneously. When, for example, replicating an application in this type of environment, it is critical to be able to do it in such a way that preserves write ordering to ensure data integrity at the target site.
Satisfy customer needs and hence more business.
