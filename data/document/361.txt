George Boole Institute for Data Research
*
*
Create an Institute as a leading centre for scientific research, training and educational outreach in Data Research.

Its mission is to advance our understanding of Big Data, Data Analytics, future storage and computation study including Quantum Computing stimulating the breakthroughs that could transform our future. 

Boole would collaborate constructively with the surrounding academic community, in particular by creating outstanding educational and research opportunities for graduate students.

Boole would also train the next generation of thinkers and creators through innovative programs, it would also share the excitement and wonder of STEM and the importance of future scientific breakthroughs with students, teachers and the general public.

George Boole was a mathematical genius who was appointed the first Professor of Mathematics at University College Cork in 1849 where he developed his most important work, ‘An Investigation of the Laws of Thought’.

Boole is described as the ‘father of the information age’ due to his invention of Boolean algebra and symbolic logic.

His legacy surrounds us everywhere, in the computers, information storage and retrieval, electronic circuits and controls that support life, learning and communications in the 21st century. 

I think it only fitting that EMC celebrate this monumental figure through the name of our new Institute - The George Boole Institute.
