More teeth to host base data migration software - Powerpath Migration Enabler (PPME)
This challenge reduces the incoming volume of High Severity SRs generated by EMC data migration software - Powerpath Migration Enabler (PPME). This will further increase customer satisfaction.
Being an SME in Powerpath, i have worked on this product for Past 6 years. Based on my Experience and high severity escalations from customer that i have handled and customer feedback, i am submitting this idea.
There are many customers who are ok with powering down of their passive nodes in the Microsoft Failover Clusters. We need to provide the customers to choose whether they are ok to keep the passive nodes powered off or they need to do the Migrations with all the nodes in the clusters up and running. 
We need to Provide the same functionality in Powerpath Migration Enabler (PPME) that existed till Powerpath version 5.5 SP1.
We can work with Development team and provide this change.
This will reduce a lot of High Severity SRs that are opened during the change windows when the customers are unable to do the migrations and also they cannot failover the resources to other nodes. 
This will also increase customer satisfaction in EMC data migration software - Powerpath Migration Enabler (PPME)
