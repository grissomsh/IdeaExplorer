Employee Rotation to all BUs.

I have got this idea when I reading the challenges.
Rotate all the employees to all the different Business Units inside EMC offices and across the geographies for a short period of 3-5 days in a regular interval. This will help to grow the xBU developments, collaboration,  knowledge sharing and understanding the each BUâ€™s capability and work style. This will definitely bring excellent improvements in the key area of innovation and redefine.
