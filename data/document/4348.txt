Smart Phone and Smart phone Operating System

Change is Consistent! Growth of Smart Phone industry and newer demands sets the new trend and hence, many new Hardware manufacturers in Industry.

Why not EMC to be part of a Smart Phone business or Smart Phone OS Seller business? While we have an great opportunity to deliver the heightened device and Opportunities are absolutely inevitable.
Develop a indigenous new Smart phone hardware.

Develop a indigenous new Smart Phone Operating System, which can support EMC Smartphone hardware and /or Other Smart phone manufacturer hardware
(here, EMC should partner with other smart phone hardware Manufacturer(3rd Platform)).

My Strong preference would be to Develop a Hardware for Smartphone or Initially shall partner with the other Mobile Hardware Manufacturer (3rd Platform) for facilitating with dedicated hardware.

This device should be highly scalable and should allow the Apps (developed for Other competitors (Ex: Android)) to be installed on the EMC Smart Phone.

It should have an Strong storage inbuilt capacity (ie. 8GB), memory and  processor. Also an dedicated App that enables access to EMC Storage (Free) Application.

CHILD SECTION: Parents & Family member having major challenge when the Kids access their Cell Phone/Smart Phone, potential risks are high. Ex: Kids/Adult can knowingly or Unknowingly could access Internet Adult Content sites, Buying apps and Games etc.,

Child Section Application /or Settings, ensures that the Kid would not be able to access all Features of the Smart Phone, the App just allows to access the Contact Directory, Camera and Permitted games.

The Child App /Settings is Password protected should be managed by parents/Guardian.
