Social Responsibility app
My idea is about encouraging the employees participation for better involvement in local communities and employees participation in submitting ideas for better utilization for resources.
No specific history for the idea.
My solution is create a mobile that can gather ideas from local employees in each EMC office depending on its location and vote for the best ideas that have the best and effective impact that lead to a better utilization to our social responsibility resources (whether budget or manpower), this app can be used for social involvement or help with the rescue efforts in international or regional catastrophes.
if it's implemented it will improve the process of employees involvement and enhance productivity by encouraging the employees to engage in extracurricular and volunteering activities and enhance EMC image of social responsibility and give back to our communities.
