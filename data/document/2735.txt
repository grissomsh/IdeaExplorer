Multifunctional ID on mobile device

We would like to think that our idea will help EMC create a modern and fun workplace.
This idea will make for an easier way to interact with EMC facilities and utilities.

We came up with the idea to use the ID in more ways to enter the facilities as well as minimize the possibilities of loosing the ID.
Since then we have been adding features for the ID usage, as well as working on other ideas,  and all of them will be added in ONE big idea to involve them all.

What I am proposing is simple. ONE ID ON YOUR PHONE.
More or less like digital credit cards, this is what I am aiming for with this idea.
Transforming EMC's traditional ID into a digital one, that does not only control your access to facilities but everything else.
This ID will be your logging tool to Cisco phones, printers, laptops..etc.
It will even be your meal card, the possibilities are endless !!
As for the systems that require extra security and the ID swipe is not enough, we can use a two step log-in system.

This will minimize the possibilities of people loosing their ID or forgetting it, will save printing cost for IDs/meal cards and so on.
One digital ID to replace all.
