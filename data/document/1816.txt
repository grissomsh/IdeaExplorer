The electricity generating chair !!
The challenge encourages the creation of a modern and fun work place and this idea definitely addresses those two characteristics. Adding values as health awareness and saving energy plus fun to the workplace.
this Idea was introduced to the market as an innovative approach for saving energy and i think introducing it to the work place would be really rewarding.
-The solution is to introduce a special kind of desk chairs.
-The first kind is the (Pedal while you work chairs) adding pedals to the chair with a unique design that ensures comfort as well as introducing exercise to your work day. 
Those pedals could also be used to generate electric power sufficient to charge your cell phone, give extra minuets to your laptop life or light your desk lamp. many designs have already been introduced to the market generating electric energy from kinetic energy. also many studies found that gentle cycling (at about a third of maximum cycling capabilities) had a positive effect on work performance â€“ speed reading improved by 30 percent, time management was better and mental abilities were sharper.
-There is another kind of chairs which generates electricity just from the pressure or heat of your body against the chair.
Both kinds introduce new features and make the office a fun ,cooler work place.
  
if this idea is implemented it will add fun, exercise to the work place lifting the employees spirit up and at the same time would be a step towards economic consumption of energy.
