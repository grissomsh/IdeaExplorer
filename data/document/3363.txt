Submit & Go

NA
A new wasy way of Supporting our EMC customers will be the "Submit & Go".

The "Submit & Go" will enable EMC Customers to submit their problem through that portal and the issue they are facing with their devices.

Once a problem is submitted an SR will be opened and the process will start by having one of our representatives/partners calling them.

What happens now is that a customer calls and ask for help, an SR is opened, we try to solve the issue remotely, if it doesn't work, a field engineer takes care of it.

This process take a long time.

By having the "Submit & Go" tool, the customer will submit their problem and through the tool it will be taken care of, if it doesn't work, again through the tool a field engineer will take care of it.

Throughout the whole process, customers could have access tracking their SRs
