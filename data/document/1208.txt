Continuous integration optimization
This solution is to optimize continuous integration, reduce development process time.
Idea belongs to Alexander Maklakov.
On June 19-20th in Russia COE passed Hackathon event where we created simple prototype.
Solution is to analyze changes that developer makes, and run tests only for these changes.
Solution includes 2 steps:
1) Collect information about existing tests and source code once in some time (for example in nightly builds).
2) Run tool to get list of tests to run based on developers changes before tests started.
We found no analogs on market which means this idea is unique.
If idea will be fully implemented in would optimize a development process and enhance developers productivity.
