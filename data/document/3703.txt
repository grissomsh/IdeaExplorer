Need Cross BU Training with Hands-on/live demo Experience.

The idea was generated based on observing the people knowledge who are just attended the training, but dont have luck in Hands-on environmental exp in specific technology
The knowlegde gained through Clasroom/online training will be lost in week or in a month. My sugesstion is to have Cross BU live environment Training like whenever PS team doing implementation of any technology,
People who are interested to learn from other BU's should be trained/allow them to see what PS Team is implementing. Seeing the live environment will give more grasping power/confidence to work on the technology .Our end goal is ,everyone should be well trained and ready to answer the client queries at the quicker rate.
