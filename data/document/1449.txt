Better elevators availability and reducing electricity
N/A
Some times a mass of people are ordering both sets of elevators denying service for other requester and the elevator would be making more trips consuming more power and electricity
Both sets of elevators' software can be connected together. Thus they can have a smart decision of which one to reach the person's request floor.
Reaching the requester can be based on the 4 resources (2 pairs of elevators) and the nearest elevator to the requester.
