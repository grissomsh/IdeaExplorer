Combine computer vision and Dedup technique to reduce IT cost  in Video Surveillance application
To detect abnormal behaviors in video surveillance applications ,it usually requires the application to record all the scene day and night. It takes a lot storage space and have to delete old video records to reduce cost.

My idea is to selective store vi
got the idea in the daily life
The solution has two component: abnormal behavior detection and dedup.
In front-end , the application keep the video frames in cache and use computer vision analysis to find the abnormal behavior in , if the abnormal behavior was detected ,the application will push those video frames into storage back-end . If there is duplicate video frames ,those duplicate frames will be deduped by storage back-end
The solution will reduce IT cost, and improve the customer experience when they need to replay the video because there is little noise in video records.
