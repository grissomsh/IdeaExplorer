EMC brand awareness for Primary/Secondary schools

Idea came about from trying to come up with ways of making EMC a household name like Google etc...
Ask EMC employees to volunteer to go to the primary or secondary schools that they have previously attended to showcase EMC and promote as a company to work for. Have special presentation packs to aid with this. Make it fun/interactive/spot prizes etc... Advertise EMC at a local level and spread the knowledge of the brand wider. This will be beneficial to both EMC and the schools involved.
