Enhanced Serial Console to access the VPlex directors!

Prior Work experience
Build a USB access to the serial console to the directors (one for each director in the engine). Have a "MOXA" serial console device connected to the director via USB. Assign a IP to the MOXA device. 

And now, we can access the director easily via serial mode using Moxa IP. Reboot the director and see what's happening during the mode of reboot. 

This helps in during the critical stages to understand what's happening when a director reboots. 

16 port Moxa will be perfect for the Clustered VPlex systems. 

Current approach to have serial access is cumbersome for debugging!
