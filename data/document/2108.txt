A Solution for Full Text Search Performance Issue Caused by Low-Privileged Users
This solution goes to Enterprise Content Division (ECD) Challenge.
This solution is trying to solve a full text search performance issue caused by low-privileged users in xPlore. xPlore is a component of Documentum.

We came up with the idea when discussing this issue with Zed.
This solution will inject user and document permission into full text search. That is, only records that the low-privileged user is authorized to access will be returned by Lucene search engine and sent to the security filter.
Please refer to this document for detail:

The performance of xPlore for low-privileged users will be greatly improved when this idea is implemented.
This solution can also be used by other full text search products.
