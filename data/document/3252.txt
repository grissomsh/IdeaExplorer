Consolidated Lab fro India COE (CS department)

- Many times we lack lab resources to deal with customer's issue
- There are different teams in CS, every team has its own lab
- If we can consolidate the lab we can our own small set up where we have many resources
- Roll based access should be used to limit the access of different teams to different products
- Concerned team should be given all rights, whereas all other team should be given (read only access)
