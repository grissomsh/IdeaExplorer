Experimenting with data propagation through social networks (and forming mathematical models)

This idea was generating while thinking about the community involvement challenge for high school students.
This project will be based on a cloud / mobile / social application. Ambitious students are encouraged to develop components of the application, such as the initial cloud and mobile app or extensions to them to extend the experiments. The implementation will include a NoSQL database running in the cloud and a simple mobile application that students will run on their phone. There can be many variants of the experiments. Such as each day at a certain time a message will be automatically generated and sent to the user's phones, they acknowledge when they have received the message, the acknowledgements are sent back to the cloud server including the date-time and geographic location it came from. Students can then create a plot or animation showing the progression of when and where acknowledgements come from. Social network overlays could be created, such as by friend connections on Facebook, and sparse periodic messages can be auto-generated on the network and auto-acknowledged when a student is active on their phone. Again the propagation can be tracked and modeled, this time originating from a point. The number of initiating messages would be limited so that the number of messages wouldn't overwhelm end users, but the propagation data on the server would be available for all students to analyze.
This project will encourage students to think about math, statistics, modeling, computer science (mobile / social / big data), relation to other sciences and social sciences (such as propagation of diseases, genetics, technology, ideas, foods etc). It will also encourage thought about the changing peak demands throughout a day such as for electrical power, compute resources, water etc.
