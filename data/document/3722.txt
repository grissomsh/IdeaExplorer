A data mining approach for analysis of duplicate/similair customer escalations

Idea comes from the data analysis implementation in some internet products.
- TF-IDF and Cosine similarity are algorithms frequently used when trying to determine similarity between two vectors/ documents by many internet products, like Google News ( for clustering the differenct stories from different sources)
	- TF-IDF, term frequency–inverse document frequency, is a numerical statistic which reflects how important a word is to a document in a collection or corpus. It is often used as a weighting factor in information retrieval and text mining.
	- Cosine similarity is a measure of similarity between two vectors of an inner product space that measures the cosine of the angle between them.
	- By working together in comparing documents, TF/IDF assigns weight vectors with weight score to each functional word in a document. Cosine similarity is then used to measure the similarity of the two documents from their weight vectors generated by TF/IDF.

- Here my idea is to use the similarity techniques on analysis of customer escalations (or service requests) by comparing problem descriptions and production logs, when there is a new customer issue reported, the data-mining method could faciliate support engineers to find the possible similar ones which already reported/had a solution in the system.

- And the idea also could help IT orgnization for big data analytics in EMC.
