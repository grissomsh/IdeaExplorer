Utilize your employee's utilization.

We got the idea in an ideation session while we were thinking about a new way to engage make a cross culture for a great organization like the global services.
Its a portal, that would be available for management level and HR for the Global service or any other department. It will show the utilization of EMC Employees worldwide in different fields. The utilization
of employees will be measured by the number of working hours. 

How this portal can be useful ? 
For example if there is a temp vacancy for a certain project or job title, this portal can be used to find the perfect person to fit for the role, based on
utilization, skills and qualification, and ability to relocate in certain areas. This criteria will be determined by every employee with his direct manager and based on a % per mobility of the team.

EMC will internally hire someone that is already underutilized/want to increase the rate of his utilization/ Or already utilized but is keen to examine his skills into another location in his area to work on the  project. 

That way, EMC can save the training time that they would have to offer new hires for temp projects, and fully utilize their employees and this would be a great chance for a lot of employees. And for sure a great opportunity to cross culture and get more experience in his field.
