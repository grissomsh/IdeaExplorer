Big Data On-Demand Solution: All-in-One Solution for Big Data Projects

The idea came to me after taking the Data Science course and thinking how a lot of tools and human effort is needed to complete a Big Data project with all its complexities
Big Data is very complex concept at the meantime. The complex efforts required to complete a big data project are still confusing and require the collaboration of different subject matter exerts (Statisticians, data scientists, implementation delivery engineers â€¦).
This new concept will enable EMC to implement a solution that can be sold as COTS (Commercial Off The Shelf) product for Big data.
The Solution will have easy to follow wizard like steps to implement a big data project:
-	Complete infrastructure for storage (EMC Hadoop or Greenplum for example) 
-	Data loading tools to load the data
-	Ready-made data models that can be categorized per data type such as:
o	Natural language Analysis
o	Social Analysis
o	Statistical models
-	Analytics and reporting tools that can be used to represent the data analysis performed by the solution for each project
This solution will leverage different EMC 3rd platform products like pivotal cloud, EMC Hadoop, ViPR and will boost our 3rd platform sales through streamlining the Big Data project process.
In addition, this will create a breakthrough in the Go To Market for big data projects by having an end-to-end one-stop shop solution for big data projects from data loading until data analytics and representation.
