Global Hardware Sharing system integrated with OnRack
GPE: expand the usage of OnRack for Lab hardware management.
Durham: Provide the opportunities for sharing equipment in a central pool, or between product development groups
GMS system (https://ghtsgsm.corp.emc.com:9090/) has been used in GHTS for years and has gained ver y good feedback in hardware sharing.  And we have submitted this system as an idea before:https://innovationcentral.corp.emc.com/#menu_view_ideas?id=2014000917


With OnRack project on, we see opportunities to do more things like automatically discovery hardware, detect hardware configuration, detect hardware errors. 

1. Provide a central hardware sharing and reservation system to store/manage all hardware. We already have one: https://ghtsgsm.corp.emc.com:9090/

2. Integrate onRack on hardwares and this system to enable automatically discover, register hardware in the system. Report broken hardware if there is any.

3. Customized power saving policy could be applied on hardware. Can automatically shut down hardware  if no one uses it.

4. Web API exposed for other automation usage.
1. Cost saving. No need to ship hardware across sites. Power saving policy.
2. Efficiency improvement. 
3. Save manual effort to maintain hardware.
