Automated Business Continuity Solution for Mid and Small Sized Companies

wanted to leverage BRS product as alternative to storage BCP products
My solution is about an automated tool which can run on any application servers in conjunction with EMC BRS products such as Networker/Avamar/Atmos. My idea is to combine the best features of
1)	Source One â€“ On-demand data recovery (eg Attachments to email)
2)	DataDomain NFS/CIFS Share or SAN Storage
3)	Leverage Avamar or Networker Filesystem eg Exchange GLR used to restore individual messages
4)	Flash Recovery Area in Oracle
Assumption is Customer using EMC BRS product (along with DD). Solution involves creating automated recovery app that will run on Client (Application Server) and integrate with Application (SQL/Exchange/Lotus). This recovery app will integrate with EMC BRS product and DD to find the last successful full and log backup and provide it as a virtual drive using DD NFS/CIFS, to Application server.

This virtual drive (DD CIFS/NFS share) will be acting as a failover (BCP) when there is data availability issue for application. Virtual drive can be presented as a location where application can come up (similar to instance access in VM) and keep running while in background the actual data recovery can happen.

Advantages
1)	Less or no RTO as application can come-up using the data in virtual drive.
2)	Can be used by Testing Team to check the application readiness in a non-disruptive manner.
