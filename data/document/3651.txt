The Vmax Challenge

This idea originate from a GBS  Idea Generation Session
The Vmax Challenge is a remarkably fun and instructive design exercise that encourages teams to experience simple but profound lessons in collaboration, innovation and creativity. 
The task is simple: in eighteen minutes, teams must build the tallest free-standing structure out of 20 sticks of spaghetti, one yard of tape, one yard of string, and a cardboard cutout of a EMC VMAX product.The figure needs to be on top.
The Vmax Challenge will encourage students to think about what it takes to dramatically increase innovation, one of the keys in the cloud computing world.
