Relating the webex session number and chat transcript to the related SR.

1: While taking transitions from other GEOs and from other teams, most of the time the update was like;
“Did webex and resolve the issue” Very few engineers used to provide a detailed description of troubleshooting.
2: While watching some of the escalated/complex, encountered the same thing.

This will help a lot during the transition of the SR. Whoever will take the SR, will be aware of the commitment made to the customer by the previous engineer.
It will also help during the SR audit process.
We can make it as an automated process. While ending the webex session, the application should ask to put the Service Request Number.
Or we can copy paste the chat transcript and update the SR notes.
