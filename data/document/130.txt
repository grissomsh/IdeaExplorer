Unfied Scale Out Flash Storage - using XIO
The flash storage market is mainly for performance.Even the completitors dont support the file level access using the flash storage.
EMC unified Flash architecture using XIO should provide the extreme performance for both block & file level protocols.
I was looking for some XIO projects and learned XIO and based on customer demand we came with this idea.
The unified architecture where the storage controller should be capable of handling both the file level & block level access.
OR
The otherway is to integrate Datamover to XIO so that the unified architecture is accomplished.
It impoves the customer satisfaction and enhance the technology.
