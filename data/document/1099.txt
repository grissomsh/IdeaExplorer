UTMS usage enhancement 

The purpose of this idea is to improve the Application Life-Cycle management tool we are using almost every day.
Our test team's daily work. We need UTMS to create/execute test cases and track the test process. We want to improve this tool to make our work easier.

1.In the test set-->test case-->Details, it should list the test steps in order that we can learn the detail execution methods in advance. 

2.The test case should list at least 3 detail execution histories in the case details in order that we can find the right man when we have any confusion about this case.For example, test case A came from the KittyHawk test plan and it was executed several times before. When we add A to our new test set , if it listed the execution history (failed/passed history, why failed, any comments before, any related ARs etc.) in case details, it would help too much.

3. After filed an AR and added the AR number to the case running result. It should support to enter the Remedy system by click the AR number in the UTMS.

It will save testers' time in unnecessary process and improve their work efficiency.
