Utilities Control System
This idea is about create a solution that would leverage and increase the efficiency of the cities infrastructure and connecting the consumers and the suppliers together by using the storage, data analytic tools and networking to handle the resources at the actual real-time consumption.
No specific history for the idea.
My idea is to create an app that is compatible with different platforms like Android and iOS that consumers can connect through to a system at the utilities' suppliers, with this app consumers can control the utilization and it can set a limit to the utilization and automate the process of billing paying and plan their their futuristic utilization increase and suppliers with this system can able to predict future bottlenecks and plan for upgrades or expansion depending on the actual needs and at the time of peak consumption can provide tips for consumers to decrease the utilization which increase the efficiency of our resources and infrastructure.
If the idea is implemented, we'll have a complete solution to provide customers which increase our revenue and integrate EMC products more in the infrastructure and public sector markets which it would increase our customer satisfaction and improve our products.
