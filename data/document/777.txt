Installing a Relaxation Massage Chair for Charity
Enabling EMC to be a great place to work, more introduction for EMC to the social Egyptian life as a marketing value, and share in raising money for charity for the social community.
The idea came up when I was waiting for a long time in Istanbul Airport waiting for my flight which is almost the same amount for me staying at my office. However, the airport is unlimited compared to the office which I can walk around unlike the office but I still needed some relaxation. 
It is unique considering some relaxation for employees for a better restart especially that employees spend lots of time in front of laptops on their chairs.
Success of my idea is related to the following:
- Relaxation of employees during the work for a good restart up.
- Refreshing your body after speding hours on your desk chair to avoid any back hurt.
- Raising awareness for EMC in the Egyptian market through charity raised from the chair's used. (A Chair per floor would raise a good sum of money monthly)
