What Activities you like? – Increase employees engagement in Activities

The idea came when we saw many employees has common sport to play weekly but they did not get to know each other as there was no COE gathering for this specific sport.
The idea is simple. The COE to build an online page/portal for suggestions from all employees for new activities to be held (for example: having a gathering in certain sport or periodic trips). This can be integrated to “Inside EMC” portal launched recently as a unified portal for all EMC employees.

The management and the COE club can review the suggestions and can announce them for voting by employees. Then the highest voted activities can be launched. This approach will help us diversify the set of activities we have and hence increase the engagement rate by the employees.
