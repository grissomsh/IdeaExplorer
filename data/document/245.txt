A Federation Business Data Lake Solution for Financial Data Services Industry
The proposed solution articulates how, Federation Business Data Lake in conjunction with ECD products such as Syncplicity, InfoArchive and Documentum xPlore can offer a robust IT infrastructure to enable data management and analytics needs of Financial Data Services Industry.
When we combined our collective experience in Financial Data Services as well as IT Infrastructure industries, the possibilities offered by EMC Federation products became obvious.
EMC's enterprise hybrid cloud solution can take care of this industry's ever growing data storage needs in the most cost efficient way. The unique enterprise content needs of this industry can be addressed by adding data services of ECD products like InfoArchive and Documentum that can handle any kind of data type. Documentum xPlore can be an excellent choice for the enterprise content search needs of this industry since it is based on a enterprise-grade proven platform like Apache lucene for content indexing, search and hit-highlighting. Syncplicity can be used to make data reception from multiple agents a near real-time possibility in a secure way. We can integrate our Federation Business Data Lake solution that provides a rich set of applications capable of "Real-time analytics, Interactive analytics and Exploratory analytics" for enabling the analytics needs of this industry since the content is a mix of structured, semi-structured and unstructured data.
If it were to be implemented, we are sure to make a huge impact in the industry. Financial data services is a more than $50 billion industry which heavily relies on highly reliable, available, high-performing and real-time computing IT infrastructure. We could be first movers in creating a niche domain worth millions of dollars. If implemented successfully, it could offer us a great success story for the federation strategy.
