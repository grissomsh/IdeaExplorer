Optimized Converged Storage

Came up this idea when I read converged storage related articles.
Traditional IT were enabled by compute, network and storage, but in the converged architecture, they all in one box. compute, network and storage are standardized and supports virtualization.

Optimization:
1. Compute, network and storage are connected through PCI-E rather than FC or Ethernet. This enables fast I/O speed and high throughput.

2. Load can be balanced throughout the converaged cluster, data can flows from high load node to the idle one.

3. Offer class of services based on application needs: different applications have different I/O patterns and requirements. For example, some needs higher performance while some needs big capacity. Some requires advanced data services while some just need simple stupid services.

4. Enhance data mobility. Based on this, data are also standardized and modulized can be easily migrated from one node to another.
