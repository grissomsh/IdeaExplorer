Communication tool
Viber is a mobile application that allows you to make phone calls and send text messages to all other Viber users for free.  Viber is already available on the web as downloadable app.
My daughter went to Europe, and we needed a way to communicate in a cost efficient manner than pure cell phone coverage which cost extra due to roaming rates.
Viber could possibly give the field user more mobile to mobile capability, reduce cell data usage, and phone rates.  
This would be a new IT supported product to enhance the support tools of the field, maybe best for international communications.  Maybe it cost less than Lync.
