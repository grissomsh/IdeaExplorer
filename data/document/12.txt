Terrace Gardens at EMC campus
Environmental Stewardship:

Terrace garden is new trend for having surrounded by nature. Terrace garden not only gives rich look to the campus but it is also helpful in providing good health. It helps us move towards green globe. 
the idea is to create more greenery in less space
We have many EMC campuses around the globe. For a self-contained garden all we require is a water hose and a composting unit on the terrace. Every cubic feet of space on the terrace can be used both horizontally and vertically.  
1. Stepping towards green globe.
2. Green campus.
3. More cooler and healthy environment at workplace.
4. Keeps the building cooler in more healthy way.
