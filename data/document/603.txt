Texting blocker while driving
Egypt COE Smart City and IoT Challenge
Some apps have been created to block texting while driving but they need to be enabled manually each time the user enters his car.

Example: Live2Txt
Integration between the smart car and the driver's smartphone (e.g. bluetooth pairing) ..  to automatically make all texting services unavailable during the trip.
This can be overridden in case of emergencies but only if the car is at rest. 
This should be part of a smart car/phone integration package with various features to make it interesting for users to use it (not all people will use it to just disable texting)
