Smart ID card for employees to get access to workplace and cloud printing
Cloud printing being piloted to simplify printing process and experience i.e. printing without swipe of your badge (use NFC enabled Smart ID).
If employee forgets the ID card, to get the temporary access card he/she has to follow certain steps like
1) Go to certain place - like security desk or reception
2) Provide all the details
3) Get the temporary ID card
4) EOD return the ID card
and more than that if employee loses the ID card then he/she has to pay certain amount to get the new ones.
And employee has to enter the pass-code to get the printing done.

Now a days more than 60% of the employees have smart phones with NFC capability - so why cant utilize this and have smart ID cards???
It works like this
1) Have authentication device with NFC connectivity 
2) Employee will use smart phone which has NFC connectivity as Smart ID card against authentication device  
3) Access will be provided or declined based on the validation
4) Valid user can use same Smart ID card to print the documents on photocopy machine which has NFC connectivity

Improve the process of accessing the workplace and simplifies the printing experience
