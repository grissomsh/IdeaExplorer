enhance the debug method during software development

in team meeting when we discuss how to improve the debug capability.
we can integrated some of GDB function like backtrace into our runtime code. so we can do backtrace at any time when we want.
we can implement some of these functions as one common library and then we can use these APIs for debug at our code at any position.
