Innovative Workplace Powered by DiQ (Diversity Driven Innovation Quotient) 
Core of the challenge (as described) by the Sponsors is to ensure that teams bring diverse focus to their innovation process. We believe it is hard to mandate steps for innovation as it is. So, the solution should include inherent change management process which would be best done via addressing the human side 'systematically' (awareness, case for change, how it will benefit Organization & individuals, etc.), involving each layer with accountability and enabling them with right process as well as tools. DiQ based framework for creating the Diversity Fueled Innovative Workplace ensures each of the above critical factors of change management.    
After being an integral part of DERG- India Chapter for couple of years we have observed many times our efforts, supported by leaders, to get a diverse candidate on board was failing at the last stage due to manger &/or Colleagues' hesitation to take (perceived) risk of hiring a diverse person. Here we got convinced that building a diverse workforce is more of a bottom-up challenge than a top-down. So, If we can quantify & demonstrate to managers that they can produce higher value by same # of resources through diversity fueled  innovation it will help them overcome their perception/ fears.
This well articulated challenge gave us chance to do some brainstorming & there came a Eureka moment of "DiQ".  
- Our idea addresses the problem statement via unique approach of team's DiQ (Diversity driven Innovation Quotient) based evaluation, benchmarking, intervention, show-back & gamification.
- Evaluation (can be part of GPTW Survey): Analyzes responses & Assigns team level as well as individual scores
- Benchmarking: provides team's DiQ vv similar teams (by # of people), peer teams in BU, etc.)
- Intervention: All employees- reccomendation on how to leverage your team's diverse skills/ traits to fuell your innovation; New Employees - Use of DiQ can be a unique way to get introduced to the team’s collective strength v/s individual personalities & further find the diversity you bring to the table; Managers -  Interactive dashboard depicting team’s potential DiQ based on new hire’s DiQ scenario in case of New REq/Replacement Req scenario (can be HR initiated)
- Show-back/ Tracking: Impact of Diversity on team's Invention & Innovation capability- Potential & Real
- Gamification: A leaderboard of highest/ most improved DiQ, by category for managers. Associated R&R for leaders of change.

If fully implemented, the solution has potential to make individual teams aware of their current level of diversity, innovation leverage, gaps & opportunities. Rather than leaving diversity as an Org level BHAG, it crystallizes the same for an individual manager where he has direct control to make difference, in an informed manner, which in turn benefits his own team's Innovation capability. This will also help trigger healthy competition among different managers around their DiQ scores. This mechanism will also make employees aware about their colleagues' diversity. As a collective result of points mentioned above, teams will be motivated to not only build but also to involve diverse colleagues in innovation process.
