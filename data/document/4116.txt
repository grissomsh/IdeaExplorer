Provide VCHS as a service Offering

Entering the 3rd Platform (Virtualization) of Delivery. New Business.
VCHS (Virtual Cloud Hybrid Service) is one of the top emerging technologies in the market. EMC as a product based company can build its own data center and configure VCHS setup. This can be used as a service offering to small Customers. In this way, we can host, maintain and provide support to Customers. Customer(s) will be happy that their data is managed in Cloud model.

In the advanced level we can also offer the Disaster Recovery option which comes in VCHS as well.
In cases of troubleshooting issues, we always can reach out to VMware at the back-end for support.

Note:We can use our legacy/customer returned arrays (like DMX,CX)  for this and provide cost effective solutions.
