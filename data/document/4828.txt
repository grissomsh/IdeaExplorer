Cloud may breathe

We create the idea in brainstorming (Hang Deng and Bob Yan) 
The most essential scenario of this idea is that setup a recycle system to make the cloud breath. 
It needs following modules:
A monitor module which check the system status (which part is hungry and which part is fat)
A breathing pipe which may take the new resources and excrete the unused or bad resources from cloud system
A breathing module which control the breath rhythm and decide which should be replaced or expanded
A report system which could show relative diagram or reports that reflects the quantities of resources consumed.

According to the system, the cloud could become a healthy ecosystem. It may:
1.  exchange the old resources with the fresh ones 
2.  maintain the system automatically  and make sure the cloud running well.
3.  give the suggestions to the customer which part is insufficient and which part is too much.
4.  Forecast long-term hardware/software demands of the cloud system.
