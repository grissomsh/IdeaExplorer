Meta-Data Analytics capability of DPS Portfolio is becoming a more important differentiator. Current consumption model (purcahse, install, deploy, ongoing) is not "ideal" to realize the business/technology/operational benefits to our enterprise custoemr set- And thus become a "prohibitive" factor for the market to truly apperciate the value of our portfolio offering.
In the past few years, in various custoemr engagement, DPA is becoming a good-but kinda topic. Customer likes the intelligent/analytics it brings but is wondering if this is truely worth the effort to deploy/support/operate (in addition to the whatever backup infrastructure). For those DPA customer, it is a common issue that the "value" of DPA is always under-archive -as customer just don't have a big incentive to "invest in customization" into DPA - Like, buying an iPhone with no Apps...
