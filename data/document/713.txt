Start/End Button In Sales Force
NA
Came through one of the discussion in Sales Force meetings with our manager. 
Create or add a Start and End button in Sales force that would appear for every SR to calculate the time spent on this SR. This will act as a stopwatch and can be used until another software replaces EAS and can record the time off Sales Force. 

Can add those and we can reflect that as case time in EAS as an option till another software is in place. 
Will record accurate time spent on SRs.
Can be linked to a software (replacing EAS).
Can be used as case time in EAS. 
Can be tracked.
