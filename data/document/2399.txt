Unified Federation Portal
•Queue contains the tickets which are eligible for federation swarming.
•Adding the different skill sets from all the federation queues to the current swarm queue so we have engineers from different skills sets across federation having same queue.
•I'm part of EMEA Swarm team & BEN member as well so we are working with the same concept in the Swarm team so I thought that we can increase our scope by adding the federation queues to the SWARM queue & having unified federation portal/queue.
•As BEN member I can see this will help EMC toward the 360 "transformation for the new support model but for the federation ".
•EMC "SWARM team", RSA & VMware are using now sales-force portal as ticketing system.
•Adding the federation queues to the to the current swarm queue & name it as the "Unified Federation Queue".
•Chatter Desktop in sales-force will allows to connect the engineers to work together and be more productive & the functions as below:
        1)View your Feed 
        2)Follow an SR to monitor or stay up-to-date on its resolution progress
        3)Upload files to share relevant information with group to support troubleshooting.
        4)Involve others in a discussion or request their input by using the @mention 
        5)Join or create groups to share knowledge & insights with people who have same skills. 
-On-duty engineers can set their availability in the "Unified Federation Portal".
•This will increase the TCE.
•The cost to implement this solution is very low since we already have same ticketing system & SWARM team.
•The sales-force has Chatter Desktop which will allow engineers to work together easily across departments.
