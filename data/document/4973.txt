Coordinate Code Review, AR Updates, MluSanity and Promotion Request

Get tired with lots of such tedious and valueless works.
Here are some points considered at the first glance:
1. Put MluSanity.pl execution result to a global location grouped by AR number
2. While creating/updating code review, it also generates a Promotion Request, the contents come from Code Review, MluSanity result, AccuRev, and AR from Remedy
3. The code review could also get some information from Remedy AR
4. While sending Promotion Request, the necessary information also updated into Remedy
5. The promote request could be done automatically once it is approved

Keep it simple and stupid!
