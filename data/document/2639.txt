3D holographic projection technology
Improve the communication between business unites and federation partners in multiples sites.
I was thinking on using the 3D holographic technology in the flex room or at the entrance of the of the facility, through it we can share the news of the COE, updates, , spread invitations for participations in new activities, messages from GM and managers, Achievements & appreciations.
and Building up on that do meeting using this technology in addition to the telepresence.

Holography is a technique which enables three-dimensional images (holograms) to be made. It involves the use of a laser, interference, diffraction, light intensity recording and suitable illumination of the recording. The image changes as the position and orientation of the viewing system changes in exactly the same way as if the object were still present, thus making the image appear three-dimensional.
