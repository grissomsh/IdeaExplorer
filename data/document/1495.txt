Intelligent Lab
This will improve the Lab efficiency.
As it is remote Lab, waiting for the issue fix is really a headache.
1. using Segway Human Transporter or something like that to reduce the walking time and relief the engineer. 
2. using Micro Aerial Vehicle? this machine can take photos. then Lab engineer can set them out to taking pics for issue initial diagnosis.
it will save time and projects may be closed in shorter time.
