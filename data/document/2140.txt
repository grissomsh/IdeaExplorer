Connect my EMC Mobile to the internal phone networkâ€¦ 1 handset solution instead of 2.
Connecting EMC issued mobile phones to the internal phone network would reduce the number of devices required to be carried around daily, which would ease and enable  communication Xcampus, & within all EMC sites.
As a heavily reliant user of both EMC mobile and desk top handsets, Paul Murphy initiated this idea.
Connect my EMC issued mobile phone to the internal phone network so that my desk phone calls can come through directly to my EMC issued mobile phone when I am onsite within the EMC campus. 
Feeding from this we would also like to see the Lync phone network extended to the EMC Ovens Campus, as currently available in City Gate.  

One phone which can be used as internal phone handset for work phone as well as for external mobile phone use.  Cost saving, productivity/efficiency enhancing & reduce hardware having to be physically carried around & juggled daily.
