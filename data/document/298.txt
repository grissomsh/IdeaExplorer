HR Challenge - Diversity and Innovation at a Great Place to Work: Providing a lab with state of the art technology for innovators all across EMC to build and test their ideas.

Innovators have to jump through hoops to get access to the needed equipment to try their ideas.
Create a lab with state of the art technology which can be accessed from all EMC locations to build and test the innovative ideas. Currently, employees are struggling to get access to such resources to implement and test their ideas. By having a centralized lab it will enable innovators to take their ideas to next level. 
This will help more mature ideas to the innovation challenge and foster innovation. This will make EMC a better place to work.
