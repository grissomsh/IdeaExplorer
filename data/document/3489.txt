 ViPR micro on bare metal – a storage solution for <15K Market in APJ

 
The idea came in from the readings about ViPR as a software defined storage solution

 The idea is to have one enclosure with 2 or 4 TB disks equipped with a ViPR micro edition to communicate with it and manage storage.

The software defined storage approach will enable us to :

-	Cut cost overhead added by different hardware types 
-	Offload processing from HW to SW which cuts the cost and improves scalability
-	Cut the cost of unnecessary modules such as DAEs, control stations..etc.
-	The storage box will have 8 iSCSI and 8 FC IO cards to communicate with the ViPR engine
-	Features are added and customized per customer’s request : pay as you go
