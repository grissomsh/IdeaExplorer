Solar Charging plug for mobile charging

I was at an exhibition for environmental and power saving where there was a booth used for charging mobiles and giving light though a small lamp which was very easy and simple to implement
Sticking a solar charger to the nearest window and using it for equipment charging instead of using electricity. This could help in changing the employee mindset to think consider other eco-friendly energy sources in addition to electricity.
