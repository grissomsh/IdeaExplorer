Group based tagging for similar devices
In future there will be explosion of devices . Therefore tagging each individual device will be a difficult process. So Intension is to build a flexible system  which could form a cluster of similar devices from tagging purpose.
This is part of Innovation Mining workshop.
Build a system , which can identify similar devices and tag them based on the common behavior. So basically the proposed system will be a cluster based tool to identify and tag similar devices. 
The biggest advantage of this system would be its ability to identify and tag any number of devices based on some existing behavior.
Above solution is not yet available to monitor IOT devices.  This proposed solution would be useful in near future , when there will be large number of devices in IOT space.
