Meeting Room Utilisation
Meeting rooms are block booked and not been used to their full potential. Resources are valuable and enable greater tools on the communications and operations side of the business.
We carried out a brainstorming session and we all agreed that this is a big issues across GMO.
There should be an inactivity sensor in the room and after 5/10 minutes the room should become available and there should also be a screen status with a must accept/decline in a given time. The GUI and the room status are interconnected and then synced and updated. The GUI allows visual confirmation of Room status.
There should also be a visual display outside the room to let you know that the room has become available also. This will really improve customer satisfaction and save money as well.
Room availability is a tool needed to enable communications, lets ensure we use them properly. Technology is there too.
