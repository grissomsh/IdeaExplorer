 Centralized Test Lab â€“ Accelerate time to Market and Product Development by accelerating testing  

the idea came up from working on the New VNXe KittyHawk and using its simulator
 The idea works as follows:

-	For any product release, there is a huge amount of testing needed. Development team and Engineering team are the ones who do this in nearly all the cases.
-	We would like to use the huge collective effort combined from different support teams across all Geos in the testing process. 
-	We will have a central lab over the cloud that is accessible to all TSEs supporting this product to run their test scenarios. 
-	Each test scenario will have its own logging returned back to the TSE. He can also consult with SMEs/Engineering 
-	For example: a new product release of VNX is being released (Rockies), the central test lab will be accessible to all VNX support teams to run their tests.

Product simulators can also be used such as VNXe3200 KittyHawk simulator.
