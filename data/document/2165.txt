save paper, go green!
Everytime we claim bills, we have to take the print outs of the bills and submit in drop box. There is a lot of wastage of paper due to this.
Every month, thousands of pages are wasted in EMC just for claiming bills. This should be cut down and the method i suggest should be adapted to save unnecessary wastage.
By digitalization on bill submission i mean that we should create a portal maybe under icoe portal where we can upload the bill cover pages in supported formats, that would help us to acheive a hassle free, easy and more convenient submission of bills every month. Apart from it, we can contribute to our environment by saving papers.
By digitalizing the bill submission and making it online on EMC portal, we can contribute to the go green initiative and set an example for other organisations to take measures to protect our environment.
