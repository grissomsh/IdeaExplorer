Create CEIP (Customer Experience Improvement Program)Program: Data driven decisions to improve Customer Experience
The Customer Experience Improvement Program (CEIP) would give all EMC customers who voluntarily opt in,the ability to contribute to the design and development of EMC products and thereby enhance Customer Experience.
During brainstorming TCE ideas and what Microsoft does with a similar CEIP program.
CEIP would collect information from customers who opt in,about how our customers use EMC products and about some of the problems they encounter. EMC could use this information to improve the products and features customers use most often and to help solve problems. Participation in the program would be voluntary, and the end results are software and product improvements to better meet the needs of our customers. CEIP program could collect information about EMC products as well as limited information about third-party applications that interact with EMC products.
It would be an application or agent that can be installed in the product during installation. It would provide the customer with information about this application. It would also provide an option to "opt in" or "opt out" at any time for the customer.
