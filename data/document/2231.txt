OnRack Federation
We propose a solution to manage and schedule hardware not only cross different LAN but also cross multiple data centre with a single interface.  
We have a PoC project called Unified M&O, which is very similar designed with OnRack. We met the problem of how to manage hardware elements across LAN. This idea is one of our plan.
Our solution is provide a federation architecture to OnRack. There are two tiers approaches: 1. Inside a data centre, but different VLAN. As we all know, only DHCP components need to be in a same L2 network, other other components, like FTP, DNS, and OnRack logical components can be shared. The only thing we need to do is put a each network a thin agent, which only contain DHCP related components for bootstrap; 2. For different sites of one data centre. The connective between them should be WAN, and one option for the communication protocol is https. Since we know OnRack provides north interfaces with RESTful API, that we can design a HTTP wrapper for internal protocol, which resident in the federated site, is a receiver of HTTP, and translated HTTP requests to internal protocol. So the federated OnRack can use the same logics with common OnRack. 
Expand the OnRack management to across LAN, even across sites of data center.
