Socio-technical workshops
The Challenge is to have a diverse set of people involved in innovation my Idea is to get top talent from different geographies under one roof for a Innovation boot camp and give opportunity to Ideate, discuss and Innovate.
Having worked for EMC with different people across different cultures there I feel there is very little interaction among the diverse group of employees apart from common tools like communicator, phones or meeting. If given a chance to mix with people of diverse cultures it would be beneficial for EMC 
My Idea is to identify top talent across different ethnical, regional and social background across all its offices around the globe either by nomination or though competition and get all of the people under one roof for a certain period of camp for a boot camp and give them an opportunity to meet, discuss, collaborate and share diverse views and come up with a unique solution to any given problem or to Innovate on any challenge
Give opportunity to EMC employees to interact and meet with people form different cultures and share ideas, learn and gain experience on approaching solutions though diverse perspectives.
