Smart Study Room
The Smart Study room , is divided into two parts :
1- the study room provided at EMC'S office  is a permanent room with all things any one might need while studying, Wifi availability in the room,  a PC connected to large screen and a printer , the PC contains most of EMC Courses and materials  , so any EMC employee can access materials easily , download or print needed documents , also comfortable chairs integrated with a desk, several white boards, Employees can group there to study same or different materials
2- the Virtual online study room, can be accessed by anyone  in the middle of studying a certain course , each course can have its separate chat room available 24/7 and link with documents or presentations uploaded and provided by EMC instructors summarizing , explaining or providing tips about that course,
chat room available so anyone can log in to it and share knowledge or ask anything to his colleagues studying same material.
-The idea came when I started to study some courses, having colleagues studying same materials, sharing knowledge with them and encouraging each other make studying a way easier and fun.
This idea will  help  employees studying same materials to share knowledge and to encourage each other either employees in same COE using the physical study room  or Employees  from all countries, all accessing the website and chat rooms specific to each course.

- This will enhance diversity and inclusion.
- Help and encourage any employee who wants to study certain course to share information and  get support from other colleagues.
