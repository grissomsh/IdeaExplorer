Cloud Based Gaming (Office of the CTO Challenge)
Online Gaming brings in a very big revenue yearly and big Video games company are starting to think how to move online gaming to the third platform, how to move from the idea of using the host resources and the resources of the server that the game based on
EMC can find a vast market opportunity if tackled that problem using its resources of Cloud.
Personally I enjoy online gaming and I read an article lately that video gaming companies are trying to move towards the third platform, so i thought EMC already has already the resources to invade that market.
EMC can use the third platform to invade the online Gaming market by using the third platform resources and Cloud resources to create cloud based video games removing the load from the user and now the user computer specs wont make a difference, the user wont need a powerful computer to run high end video games.
If this idea is implemented EMC will invade a new market creating new opportunities using the resources of the third platform and cloud, Moreover EMC will be leading new customers in their journey towards the third platform. Also this will bring a huge revenue to EMC as the Gaming community is huge and generates a big income.
