Notes for handling different customers

As the support is one of the main areas that affect the TCE it's important to know the best way to approach each customer when handling his problem.

One of my friends working at vodafone has mentioned that they have a similar system
A place for the TSE to write how he managed to handle the customer and if there are things, words or sentences that may make him angry.
this will help that miss understandings and misinterpretation between both the customer and TSE is kept to the minimum
Increase the customer satisfaction
