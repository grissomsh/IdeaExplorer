Performance survey for internal collaborations
-This idea would co-relate to CSAT's and DSAT's given to our engineers by the customers.
-We can have surveys to internal collaborations so that the standard of the service provided is maintained.
-I work for the internal collaborations completely and this is when I got this idea.
-There is no criteria on which engineers working on internal collaborations can be judged. This would be a platform to judge and as well improve the standards of chats within peers.
-Also internal peer satisfaction is the leading pathway for customer satisfaction.
-When it comes to internal collaborations I see that there are lots of issues being faced by Engineers from both the ends.
-Sometimes there are collaborations opened even without proper information about the issue. This kills time and prolongs us from giving the resolution at the earliest.
-Understanding the issue correctly comes into picture. If the engineer doesn't have knowledge on the issue, understanding becomes a concern.
-Also, we tend to use Short forms or so called SMS language with our internal peers. This might become a practice which will/might reflect on the customer chats.
-This would lower the reputation of the organization.
-As previously mentioned this idea would help in improving the standard of chats within the internal peers which in turn will reflect on the customer chats as well.
-This would create a caution in every peer's mind and they would work on the chat in a more challenging way.
-The level of service would Improper if things within internal peers are taken care.
-Company would be benefited with more skilled and knowledgeable Employees.
