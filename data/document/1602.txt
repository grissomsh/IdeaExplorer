Inventory Visibility
Addressing Global Product Operations challenge:
- It helps making GPO/EMCâ€™s supply chain more efficient and effective
- It transforms the performance across the end to end supply chain in terms of cost, availability and time to market.

Supply chain improvement.
Suppliers should have visibility to inventory levels of the products that they supply to EMC, and replenish EMC inventory whenever it reaches a certain level (that was agreed before) automatically. 
This will enable very good level of product availability, with the minimum use of resources, this will cut the costs significantly and at the same time maintain a good customer service and TCE.
