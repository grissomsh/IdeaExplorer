EMC bicycles

I came up with the idea because I live in Eygpt which is suffering from a huge pollution problem so I thought of using an environment friendly way of transportation such as bicycles which will help in reducing this problem.
EMC should provide bikes in the workplace that employees can share and use especially for short distance trips. This will help in reducing the pollution and power consumption
