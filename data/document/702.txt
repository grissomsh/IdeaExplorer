HEALTH FITNESS IN HE WORK PLACE
This is one of the ideas for a workplace of the future. Promoting health and fitness withing the company. Providing employees with the option of adopting a healthier lifestyle by providing healthy meal options at the canteen and healthy food options at meetings and functions. Also improve/expand the on-site gym and provide standing desks where employees can burn up to 400 calories a day. 
This idea was developed by Suzanne Considine, Robert Creedon, Andrea Graham, Caroline Maunsell, Lorna Murphy, Conor Roche and Ivan Santry during a brainstorming session at the CTD Technology Day.  
Expanding the gym and investing in equipment would entice more employees to use the gym. Creating standing desk areas would allow employees to burn calories while they work and organizing for some fitness instructors to come on site and give classes early morning or evening would provide employees with an opportunity to get fit. A company wide operation transformation style challenge would encourage people to eat healthy and lose weight. Also ensure that there are adequate meal options for people with special dietary requirements. 
Successful implementation of this idea would see employees having the opportunity and being encouraged to get involved in activity each day. It would also see healthy eating habits being encouraged within the company. People are aware of the dangers of being sedentary and bad eating habits. If EMC can be seen to be part of the solution of such a serious problem it will be seen to be a caring employer.
