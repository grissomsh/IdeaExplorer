Fridge magnet collection

People like collect small things like baseball player cards, Disney badge, etc. It could be fun if we provide things collectable from Sustineo. I think people will love it for sure.
There are a lot of achievements in Sustineo, you can get one when you gain certain points or complete certain action. The company could prepare collections of fridge magnet for these achievements. Once an employee get an achievement on Sustineo, he will also get a magnet which has this achievement print on it. A magnet could be as the same shape as the achievement and has the same image alongside a text print on it.
You can stick those magnets on your cube, so everyone pass by can see how many achievements you got. And you can also have a goal to collect the full achievement collection. Once people get interested in these magnets, they will be more active on Sustineo.
