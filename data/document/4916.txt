Build up EMC Docker Hub for resource sharing and cost saving

Come out the idea when using development VM and think of docker's capability.
1. We can build our own EMC Lab Docker Hub which hosts template development image.
2. User/developer can search for and find an image another user built and shared in the Docker Hub Registry, a cloud-based collection of applications.
3. The images can share one central cloud environment which will save the computing resources.
4. If there is needs, the user can modify this image/development environment/test environment and push the image back to Docker Hub for sharing.
