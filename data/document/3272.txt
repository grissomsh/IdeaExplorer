Employee Health Is important



Two of my colleagues got disks from the long working hours from the harmful way of sitting during work.


I think if we get a Dr that would show us what is the appropriate way to sit on our desks inform of the computer would help benefit us as employees from injuries in the future and less sick leaves. We can get medicine balls to help adjust our way of working by helping us sit straight. This way employeesâ€™ health is safe and nothing major to worry from working for long hours.
