Deliverable storage software components
Every storage release always includes hardware and also deployed software embedded in it. It is a complex product and not easily maintained. If the software can be divided into components which can be delivered independently, it will become easy to maintain. And we can also release simplified components to community to build up related technology environment.
EMC storage bundle is very large and we have to build all every time there are some backend changes. If components are standalone and can be deployed, we only need to build the component and directly deploy it to the system. Every component is standalone and running in different container.
Divide software into two layers. The low layer is EMC hardware customized functions and the high layer is general functions. We need to define API used to invoke low layer from high layer and try to make these API to be standard. For the high layer, it can be divided into component and wrapped using docker technology so that every component is deliverable.
If this idea can be implemented, our storage system can be released within small period and every standalone component can be implemented by different team, even by 3rd party team which has strong ability on that component. Thereby, our product become part of opening and we can enhance our ecosystem.
