Harnessing technology - Town Sanitation

The need to act in this area occurs to me every single day when I travel in the city. I remember that  travel to work used to be a pleasure during my tenure at London.The healthy surroundings always made for a healthy walk. This is however not true for areas that I pass by during my daily commute today.

I have also recently moved from a crowded city area to cleaner outskirts. My health issues have completely disappeared post this move. 
Therefore, I feel this effort can make a big difference to lives of many people.

Also, with so much education and technology around I believe it is worthwhile to use the knowledge towards a basic cause like this one.

With these thoughts in mind I propose this idea.

The following presents an overview of the working :

> Teams collaborate to finalize upon the Hardware, Software configuration  requirements and Strategy for implementation.

> Get a Detailed Picture of  5  localities  in terms of  :
• Littered Areas
• Garbage Bin Locations
• Observation of Waste Segregation
• Open Drainage Pipes
• Damaged Structures
• Non - green Patches of land
• Other Challenges

> Query and Analyze the Data and Survey results at regular intervals and incrementally define Corrective Measures.
This will include educating the people on the following topics to make the locality self-sustaining.
• Pack-it-in, Pack-it-out garbage mentality
• Organizing Segregation Areas
• Allocating optimal number of Bins
• Processing Wet waste
• Recycling Dry waste 
• Planting Saplings
• Painting Stained Patches  

> Generate Statistics on the Garbage Volume per locality to  enable best possible processing of the same.

> Suggest Optimal Placements of Dry Waste Processing Plants & Compost Bins based on volumes of waste material generated.

> Engage local Government Authorities, Residents, and local Workers to monitor and maintain the areas.

> Monitor the Wards in question until achievement of  target success rate.


I believe that significant results can be produced by deploying appropriate technology & engaging employees across Global Services , NGOs (viz. the Ugly Indian) and local authorities.

1. A real time report /website is provided to track sanitation status
2. Technology provides a meticulous approach to the solution
3. Cross BU collaboration is encouraged 
4. Health and Sanitation issues are effectively addressed 
5. Applicable EMC Products and solutions can be referred to BBMP and local authorities.
