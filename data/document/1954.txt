EHC Automated Resource Scheduling, Planning and Reclamation
EHC utilizes the concept of leases when reserving VMs or services. This new service can improve this concept significantly.
This concept grows from one of the services implemented in vLab backend, which is a monolith Java application working with VCD. Evolving this concept into a self-sufficient consumable service allows to include it in VRO workflows and improve EHC solution.
The solution is a Scheduler service built in Spring Java, that implements current and future resource reservations and reclamation. All workflows providing services utilizing these resources would include a call to the Scheduler, that keeps track of the resources in its own database. 
Benefits: with that type of tracking administrators have exact picture of future resources usage rather than the prediction. Also the system can implement new type of workflow: guaranteed future reservation.
Currently none of EMC or VMware products have this kind of functionality.
The solution allows to optimize EHC resources utilization, adds capability to implement a new service (future reservations), improves EHC administrators visibility into resources
