GSAP Program.
GSAPs tune in Solutions Support as they gain insights to other products as well.
Seeing GSAPs struggling between the MS program and the office work, which divides their focus and does not provide vocational training, prompted me to suggest this idea.
GSAPs should be given option to rotate to different teams after few years (say 3 years or so). The MS program shall not be for 4 years rather should only be for 2 years, as it eats up a lot of their time and divides their focus. As well they should not be put on a bond for 5 years, rather 3 years shall be enough.
GSAPs become tuned to the Solution Support model.
