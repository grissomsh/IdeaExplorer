Enterprise software dashboard- new customer satisfaction paradigm

I thought about the idea when I faced many challenges and problems getting to the right SW, licenses, and latest releases to my large ISP WIND in Italy.
A unique and unified dashboard and portal for all our product portfolio divided in different sections to facilitate and simply the process we interact with our customers. 

The approach will not need a complex environment to be done. We will consolidate already existing infrastructure and will link many systems together.

Benefits.

1- Give the customer our best of breed of services.
2- increase customer satisfaction.
3- Ease of data collection of our customers' feedback about our new firmware and upgrades.
4- Create a new "centralized" platform to interact with our customers.
