End of Quarter Celebration
To improve collaboration and communication, through team building and unity between the employees. 
Co-op Brainstorming Session
We propose a celebration event in the Canteen right after the End of Quarter in a form of a performance. The management can use this opportunity to thank and give a token of appreciation to members of staff. Performance can be done by member of EMC or by a hired professional performer. 
If implemented, the employees would be more enthusiastic and the end of quarter may not seem so stressful leading to less workplace errors. People would attend these celebration events and socialize, therefore communication between employees would increase. Great opportunity for team building.
