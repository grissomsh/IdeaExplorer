Viking SSD ESS

Capacity constraints came up in a conversation and I was thinking of future DAE that we will be using - why not use them as test beds also.
Use Viking DAE in ESS to double-up the capacity of an ESS chamber. A Viking can store 120 x 2.5" drives, and we could house 10 x Viking in an ESS chamber.
This would allow us to test 1,200 drives per chamber.
