VNX2 - Automatic generating of SP collects and attaching to SR in special call home events
to help our support to fix problems faster (no more waiting for SP collects),
better service to our customers
customer asked me several times to make our support processes better; Thomas Rosenberg and Matthias Benz from German customer Service team were involved;
VNX people told me that there is already a comparable solution implemented, but limited to unified VNX systems only
for special defined cases (for instance not initiated hang or reboot of an SP), where a SR is generated (Call Home) it would be helpful to start a process for generating the SP collects automatically, with attachment of the files to the SR (if possible)
better customer satisfaction (not asking them to do the collecting process manually), faster solution for issues
