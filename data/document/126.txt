Improve IT productivity with deploying PCF applications
Improved the IT productivity with deploying Cloud Foundry applications. Automated deployments and flexibility with deployments.
It's common to use jenkins to schedule or trigger builds. But it's easy when we are working with single app.

For the application I am working, I had issue quickly deploying many micro services to different environments and also scaling them on need basis.
Provide Web UI to add/update/delete micro service apps and environments information.  Another Web page to choose Apps, environment, Tag for each environment, and Scaling settings and hit deploy. This should trigger a build/deployment using Jenkins Remote Access API and also scale the services as per the scaling requirements.
It provides Web UI for one click deployment for different PCF environments/spaces with specified scaling settings.
