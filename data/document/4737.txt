Utilize Big data capabilities to store, analyze and automate medical ultrasaound measurements

Ultrasound tests are important to track fetus health. 
The test cost is high in case it is done by professional doctors. 
I hope this will reduce the test cost and will increase accuracy. 
The ultrasound data will be translated to three dimensional PostGIS (Geographic Information Systems) data and will be stored in a GreenPlum DB. 
The data will be analyzed using special algorithm that will include the specific curvature for the measurement. 
The analysis will provide the required measurement size automatically, without the dependency in the Doctor professionalism and picture angle.  
The reason to use the GreenPlum product is to allow storage of huge amount of data and allow querying the data easily.
The other advantage is to use the PostGIS capability to support calculation on a rounded interface.
