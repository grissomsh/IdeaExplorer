End to End Delivery from EMC COE

Growth Opportunity, Survival in the market and Gaining customer Trust/Relationship/Satisfaction.
With EMC being a product company, we should move one step forward and start providing the services/support in other platforms (windows/unix/Database/Applications) apart from storage. With this we end up owning end to end support/delivery for a Customer. Providing End to End support/service offering always adds more value to get more customers by winning deals. Also EMC being Storage product based company is an added advantage to it as Storage/Data is the basic building block for any environment. 
This gives us more pride and also Business edge over others. EMC will grow more as a Product/Service company.
