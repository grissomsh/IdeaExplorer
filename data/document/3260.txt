Interaction With Field Engineers

- Many times I have noticed that if Field and remote support have better co-ordination , we have better approach to resolve the issue
- Experienced and knowledgeable person form Field should visit to support centers
- They should share there experience with remote Engineer
- Exchange of the knowledge between two will result in a lower TTR when customer issues comes in as Service request
