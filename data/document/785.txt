Having the Innovation portal all year long
Trying to collect more ideas that make EMC bloom.
Looking at the work environment in EMC with EOQ and the innovation portal closing both at the same day gave me this idea.
We could have an innovation portal open all year long for submitting ideas and a competition once per year as it is. This solution would prevent employees from forgetting what idea they had months before the competition started or forget where they wrote it down till the competition starts.
I would also suggest having the competition closing in a date other than the End of quarter day.
Since it’s EOQ many business departments are usually very busy during those days and since the human nature is usually lazy so the majority of the people normally try to submit ideas in the last week of the competition but some of them don’t get the chance. So even if they have ideas , they could be hung up at work and not have the time to submit them.

The portal already exists so why restrict adding the ideas in it in only 2 or 3 months? No effort will be required but the number of ideas will definitely increase tremendously.
Changing the closure date of the portal is also considered an essential factor in the number of ideas so why not make it in the winter for example and choose a date far from any public holidays or big events.
If we implement those two ideas, we would lose nothing but we will definitely win a lot more!
