"Inside EMC" Mobile Application
Creating an app that would allow crowd sourcing (crowd sourcing  simply is the process of connecting with large groups of people via Internet). Allowing all EMC employees to connect,share ideas and benefit from each other's resources.
We have had trouble trying to find information on "Inside EMC" before; due to the lack of organization in the website. Sometimes, navigating the site takes time and effort to find what you're looking for. Mobile applications, on the other hand, are easy and efficient to use. They are less time consuming and they have a friendly user interface. (Combining both facts is what produced the idea)
Providing "Inside EMC" in a mobile application form (like support.emc application), that can be accessed through both external and internal networks. This mobile application should use other authentication; not needing a VPN or the RSA security token (example: SSL certificates). It should emphasize on what's important and should provide easier navigation through "Inside EMC". It should also have a friendly, easy-to-use interface and it should be an open-platform (iOS, Android, Windows, ... compatible)
We would be able to benefit more from "Inside EMC", with a better and more user-friendly interface. The mobile application would help emphasize on what's important in "Inside EMC" and it would be easier to navigate. Clearing the token and vpn restriction
