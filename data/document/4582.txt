Improve 'Everyone Sells' program.

Everyone Sells, is ongoing, however it needs to evolve.
The points system for employees on Everyone Sells needs to be revamped and made much more attractive. EMC needs to share the sales / profit in percentage (like 1% or 2 % of sales amount). If employees see such an opportunity to earn, he / she will not leave any such opportunity, if it comes. There should be option to do a live conference with Sales team 24x7, so that such opportunities are realized. In one of the organizations I worked with, this is the way it was and sales leads used to get a good part of revenue generation.
