Develop an internal tool to map Product areas in Remedy to functionality they own
This tool will help in improving the AR triage process. Testers/Developers will be able to assign a particular AR easily to the appropriate group leading to an early resolution of the problem.
Came up with this idea while being part of System Triage team. This team is highly dependent on the mapping spreadsheet in order to assign ARs to the correct team. 
Currently we have excel sheets that do the mapping which are not up to date always. This leads to confusion when assigning ARs to particular groups. Also it is tedious to maintain these excel sheets when there is a re-org or changes in group assignments. If we have a tool that is integrated with Remedy then we will have a central place to look for mappings. Any change in a product area in Remedy (created/deleted) will have to be regulated through this common tool and hence there will never be a case where product area exists in the mapping but does not exist in Remedy
This could be implemented as a web application and standalone application (like Remedy) which enables user to search for a particular functionality and the corresponding Product area that supports it. Every product area has mapping to CLI commands, GUI screens, cp objects, cp providers, etc. And user could search GUI screens section and look for a particular wizard and find the corresponding product area that owns this screen. The current mapping spreadsheet is located here - https://teamforge6.usd.lab.emc.com/sf/go/doc97813. The tool will need to be designed such that it is able to map in product areas to functionalities like we do in the spreadsheet now. And also have the flexibility to add/remove items as needed. 

This tool will enhance productivity and optimize the AR triage process.
