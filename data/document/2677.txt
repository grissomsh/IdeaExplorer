EMC Talent Program
The EMC Talent Program connects the +100K students trained in Storage, Cloud and Big Data concepts through the EMC Academic Alliance Program every year to EMC technical teams, its partners, channels and customers' recruitment processes.
I have identified a need for recruiting in Presales in Brazil and thought that EAA students could fulfil the open positions. It was rapidly taken to Global Services team, who also saw the value of a Junior recruit with a EMC certification to join their teams. I teamed up with Ed Services to develop a training package to support a more complete recruitment/training solution that can be offered to both channels, business partners and customer.
EMC Academic Alliance train over 100k new skilled professionals every year in EMC technologies. These students have developed their IT skills during their college years and can fulfil industry open positions. EAA Talent Program will connect both ends, offering these positions to EAA students, as well as help with candidate filtering process for recruiting at Customers, Partners and EMC. Also, through Educational Services special training packs, these new recruits can develop their EMC specialist skills while participating in a shadow program, where they will team up with senior professionals.
Success of this program would be measured in # of EAA students hired by EMC, channels and customers. Also, the amount of Training Units sold to complete the new recruits' development would be a tangible measure.
