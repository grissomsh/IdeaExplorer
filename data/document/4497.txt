A Better On Boarding Experience to the EMPLOYEES

Prior Work experience
While on boarding, the employee should have his/her DESK identified, a laptop at their desk, telephone connection, etc., 

Current process is that, once after the employee joins, the cubicle is decided and then "THE EMPLOYEE needs to send a mail for a telephone connection and a ethernet cable using the laptop that is provided". 

Rather than having all these, let the company provide "THE STARTER KIT" that has the laptop, and the desk already decided and a telephone connection be in place. Also, provide the starter kit that has the necessary Notebook, Pen, Stapler, etc., Else, the employee need to go and ask for everything what they want!!

A Better way to have this is to provide a "STARTER KIT".!!!
