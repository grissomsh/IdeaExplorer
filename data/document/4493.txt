big volume, block only, small, fast storage box for China market

China start-up market quickly grows but EMC have never got a chance to help that. By combine matured technologies and release product quickly, EMC can take a active role to help Chinese enterprises to grow up. 
I talked to some start-ups and they use common low cost PCs with lots of disks as their storage system. We can do better and deduce the cost of maintaining such manual system.
There are many facts that appeal the start-up but a combination of following feature will be a game killer:
1. big volume and can be easily extend if need
2. block only and iSCSI is preferred or only option
3. RAID is not default option. Application level solution may provide solution.
4. as small as possible. Office or lab size is critical to start-up
5. fast enough. It should provide average or a little higher performance than high end storage service
6. Management (nearly) free, buy and forget is expected. 
7. Very simple license mode

We need cut most of components from I/O stack to provide those basic requirements and make sure they are robust enough. And use brand new but very simple GUI to provide minimum management interface. As an option, a rich management API is needed.
