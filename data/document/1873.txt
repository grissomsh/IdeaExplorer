3rd Platform - An App for VPlex - APPlex
This proposal is to match the challenge for TCE. 
Work Experience
Solution: 
Develop an App for VPlex that does the following: 

Rich user experience to know the status of clusters, configure the clusters, provisioning, migrations, etc.,

Send alerts/notifications to the user when the system is having any issues [much like today's call home].

Enables the customer/user to work with the system remotely thereby avoiding the physical presence. 

Upgrades the system to the next higher release with ease. No downtime required. 

The customers will find this interesting as everything is controlled remotely by an App.
