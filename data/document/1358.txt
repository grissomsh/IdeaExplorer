PaaS Workload Optimization Engine
This idea is about workload efficiency in PaaS infrastructure.
Our project is already deployed in PCF infrastructure, we got this idea of optimizing workload during large number of micro services.

Develop a system that periodically monitors applications in PCF and collect the usage metrics for each application. 

System will use of java agents like CA Willy to collect application memory statistics and will do a data aggregation to generate metrics.

The current usage metrics will be compared with configured memory of each application and this can be reported in dashboard and notified to application owners/platform admins.

Based on the report, app owners/platform admins can take a conscious decision to reduce the application memory configuration.
1. Business Unit will be able to reduce the running cost of the project as the infrastructure is effectively utilized.
2. Cloud infrastructure is optimally used.
3. This component can be packaged as a product and a solution that can be provisioned by EMC consulting team.
