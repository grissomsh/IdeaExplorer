Out Of Office: Modify to notify organizers of pre-scheduled meetings of unavailability
This would deliver improved communication, Improved functionality and convenience.


Frustration: Arranging meetings in advance, getting acceptance & finding out at meeting that people are out of office. Wastes time & resources.

Room Availability: Rooms being block booked for regular weekly meetings, however in some scenario's when people are out of office they forget to cancel booking of room. Wastes time.

Gives accurate information of people's & meeting room's availability. 
My idea helps communicate to people who have prescheduled meetings that you are out of office. 
Current solution only activates in timeline that you are scheduling to be out of office. It does not inform meeting organizers that you are unavailable. 

Gives accurate information of people's & meeting room's availability.

When a person is setting up their out of office they should have drop down options for the following: Cancel schedule meetings, Decline messages to organizers of meetings setup in time frame of being out & Cancel room booking's.

Success: Modify Outlook Option

Benefit: Clear communication, more efficient meetings & room usage, easy means of communicating to fellow colleague's that have prescheduled meetings that you are out of office.
