EMC Cycle Habba
EMC to organize mega cycling event in Bangalore on Sunday mornings to promote cycling and preserve environment.
Similar activities take place near my place where I reside and I was eager to implement the same at my workplace as well.
As a company sponsor, the League provides resources to help you plan an event in your company/area, and each year the number and diversity of Cycle Habba celebrations continues to grow, accelerating the momentum around bicycling nationwide.

It would benefit in employees having fun and spreading an environment friendly awareness among people.
