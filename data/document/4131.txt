Touch Screens in the meeting rooms

Attending a meeting with my team we face probems with the projector and had to take a screen shot of the white board to send later the meeting minutes which was time consuming.
Touch screen in the meeting room where it could have some applications to draw a charts on, write some notes and ideas…etc instead of the normal white board + projector. This is part of moving the employees mind set from the 2nd platform to the 3rd platform as per the company’s general direction.
With this idea you send all the details to the attendees and can continue adding to it in the next meeting having it saved helping you continue where you stopped the last time.
