E-mail isn't the only way to communicate
Within EMC we are heavily reliant on email to the point where people are more likely to talk over email and IM than in person. This we believe can be less productive often answering the same question multiple times to different people leading to less true collaboration and removing the fun of truly getting to know and dealing with those around you both locally and across global teams.
This submission is a consolidation of a number of related ideas generated in an Ireland IT idea generation session.
We want to move more to InsideEMC as a primary method of answering questions and sharing information. This should be available across any device which is not the case today. We want to enable refined alerts (so you get notified of what is of specific interest to you) both real and near real time that can be received how you want to receive them (SMS, invites, email if you so wish). We should have the ability of creating different types of content from discussions we have today to wiki's with community edit capabilities. Finally we should also have restricted text based app like Evernote to record and share information synced across all your devices as needed.    
By reducing the amount of time spent dealing with email, we believe we will free up peoples time for more collaboration, team work and ultimately making EMC a more fun and rewarding environment as we get more done faster and with less stress of dealing with duplicate information sharing over email.
