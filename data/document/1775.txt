EMCBnB
Enhance EMC employee interaction and collaboration while travelling the world (be it personal or work travel)
When traveling I, like most other people, have found that the cost of accommodation can often become prohibitive.  Also, when traveling alone it is sometimes nice to have a friendly face to share the traveling experience with.  In the knowledge that folks from the global EMC community are constantly traveling the world, both in a professional and personal capacity, there can be an opportunity here for EMCers to help support the traveling requirements of their fellow EMCers.
Hub for EMCers travelling accommodation requirements.  This idea would provide an online hub where EMC employees can both provide or search for accommodation for their fellow EMC colleagues.  Visualize this as AirBnB with an EMC twist.
The EMCBnB site becomes the online hub for EMC traveling support.  It would afford EMC employees the chance to become more familiar with their wider global EMC community while also cutting down on the accommodation costs.  What's not to like about this?
