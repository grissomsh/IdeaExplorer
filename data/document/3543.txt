80% vs 20% Goals for EGYPT

Every day when going to work I have tons of ideas that I want to do to improve mu country but I just don't have time to do so. Allowing me 20% of the time to achieve something that I want to do and at the same time is not work related will break the daily routine, makes me more focused at work and improve my skills.
The employee here will give 20% of his work-time and dedicate it to a project that he will do for his community. This way he will get out of the everyday routine. Also he will feel very satisfied since he's not only working for himself, but instead doing something for his country. It will make the employees improve their skills and bond together especially if they decided to do something together. This project will be recognized by the company and the employee will be awarded for it according to how good it is.
