User friendly GUI for Captiva products in the field of manipulation with list of images or documents
Documents and images are core workflow principals of ECD products, so we can make better the basic user experience in the field of manipulation with these objects
This idea has been raised during user experience with Captiva client applications like Desktop, Identification and another, in the time of development and testing it.
We can realize the modern drag'n'drop feature in our products in places where we can work with collections of images, documents, pages or another objects.
