Wind energy with every vehicle 

I got the idea while thinking for energy saving options
Current environment challenges can be overcome by designing all vehicles with possible green energy. As all vehicles are in motion during the trip, it can best act as wind generation to create reusable energy. This can be achieved by attaching small wind turbine to all the vehicles along with the solar system. This will help drastically reducing energy requirement for a vehicle.
