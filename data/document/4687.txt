Electricity Consumption Analysis

NA
Create an application for the public, to be able to track the power consumption of their households/factories, thus enabling them to monitor their consumption, and act accordingly to become more green. 

This app would generate a huge amount of data, which we can perform Big Data Analytics on to: 
-Measure the consumption usage trends of the households & factories
-Allocate the correct amounts of power resources
-Predict the usage of electricity in the future based on the dramatic expansions of our community.

We can work with the Government of Power on this massive project, by providing them with our analysis and assisting them on this task.

Benefits:
-Increase our market recognition.
-Provide the necessary tools for the community to track their power consumption.
-Proper allocation of resources.
-Power Saving.
-Future planning to prevent power outages.
-Saving money for our community.
