Windows hotfix auto discovery and installation
The idea could enable faster and more secure product development through expanded, more efficient, and higher quality Engineering Shared Services.
I have to reinstall the hotfix after reinstall the windows OS. It take me a lot of time in my work. So I think if they could be done automatically, then a lot of effort could be saved.
The windows hotfix auto discovery and installation server will check all the windows servers in Elab and install the hotfix automatically. There is no other similar solution there. 
It will optimized a process and improve work efficiency.
