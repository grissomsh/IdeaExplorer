Virtual Machine restore of backup solution with minimum RTO (15 min) using existing VM (or VM template)

While going through some VM recovery test cases, this idea came in to mind. Retrieving same data which is available in local environment will be not idea and hence suggested this solution.
At the backup time, backup agent will calculate unique hash for changed block and store it in backup server.  At the time of recovery, First backup agent will be having existing VM hash in the local DB. Agent will take snapshot and using CBT, it will filter changed block and calculate hash for changed block. When hash table for existing VM will be ready, it will retrieve hash table from server DB. Compare two tables(local vs server), filter blocks whose hash is not matching(in template case, filter blocks which are matching).
	Once block lists with info would be ready, recover "*.vmx" file and hardware information and create template from it. Backup agent will create new thread which will process block list and retrieve blocks either from local VM or backup server image.  Power on the recovered template and attach FS filter driver to it. VM will start accessing VMDK blocks and filter driver will catch read requests for blocks. If the block is already recovered, it will be accessed from new disk else based on prepared block list, driver will retrieve block either from local VM blocks or backup server blocks and write it to new vmdk disk. Read request will continue with this new block. Driver will mark processed block as new one so next read/write request for this block will continue with new vmdk disk file. Another thread will start recovery of blocks which are close to filter driver requested block(Locality of reference). once all blocks are recovered, VM will be freed from filter driver and VM recovery will be complete.
