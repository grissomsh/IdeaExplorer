 Social Media Analytics for better employees’ satisfaction 

 The idea came in when I was checking the newly launched unified social portal for all emc “Inside EMC” and how we can make use of its post towards better satisfaction for employees.
 The idea will use social media analytics techniques on :
1-	Inside EMC posts 
2-	What employees like on social media
3-	What activities they attend the most

This will help understanding employees’ preferences and hence better meeting their needs towards higher satisfaction.
