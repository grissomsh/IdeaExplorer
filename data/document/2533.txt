Leveraging Employee Career Progression
1) Pushing EMC forward in the league of "The Best places to work".
2) Introduction to career progression through live examples.
3) Increasing belongingness among employees


The above points would eventually lead to Attrition Control
During my one to one with some employees, I realized that they have spent far more number of years than the others, with scope for recognition commensurate to their tenure.

> Monitor and collate the names of employees who cross important milestones (3yrs, 4yrs, and 5 yrs).
> Display their contribution (in tenure) on a display board along with their picture and a small write-up from their managers/peers.
> Alternatively, these can be emailed to this employee, keeping all others in that team on CC/BCC

Helps boost morale` of tenured employees (>4 years)
Will help showcase the career progression path for other employees who join the organization.
