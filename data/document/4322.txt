Reduce the cab services for better enivorement. 

I have this idea since the day I joined EMC, however I did not know the right chennal to express. I am wishing that you may concider this idea now for better enivorement/our enivorement. The latest reports from NASA says that we have already crossed the treshold levels. This little change may bring a hung impact in our envirovement. 
Considering the day time that is from 7 AM to 7 PM, Employee who log-in/logâ€“out between these timings they may have to use the public transport. But an employee who log-in/log-out after 7 PM or before 7AM can use company transport/EMC cab. However the regular EMC bus services can remain the same. And company can provide BMTC bus pass (if possible) for those employees who are eligible for cab services, so that they can use this bus pass at 7 AM to 7 PM timings.
