Engineering Community 

We in support have times not been able to answer customer queries effectively and get lost trying to find authentic answers from colleagues, engineering/development would have been the right people to answer those.
This may not be an ongoing issue on the product but related to the architecture in the whole. 
Currently we only have the surge tool to engage engineering with goring problem with the customer product 
Any forum wherein support can directly engage engineering with product related questions and get time bound answers which are not end customer related.
The forum should be internal to EMC where we can get the answers directly from engineering/product development and would be helpful in understanding the product better
