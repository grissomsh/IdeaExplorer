Using the digraph to describe, analyze and optimize RESTful APIs

The idea came up when I was looking at the hypergraph models for knowledge learning. I think the bigraph model fix the REST APIs description very well.
Each resource in the REST APIs is a node in the digraph.

Each relationship between two resources is a directed edge in the digraph.

The relationship could be in different types:
* implicit type -- e.g. feed to entry containership
* declared type -- e.g. link relation
* operation result driven type -- e.g. Location header of HTTP POST method on a collection

Each directed edge has a weight on it for different relationship type.

A resource bigraph modeling tool can be implemented to describe the REST APIs and output the result into image, XML, HTML or other formats.
