Weekend (Sat & Sun) shift allowance.
ICOE employees to be slightly more satisfied working on weekends thus adding more points in Great Places to Work.
It sounds justified to be compensated more for shifts on weekends.
HR should have an improvement in the policy for weekend shift allowance. As of now the weekday & weekend (Sat & Sun) allowance for shifts at ICOE are same, an increase in the allowance will compensate the employee to an extent. Given the fact that the cafeteria too has less options employees will have more to spend on ordering meals from outside during weekends.
Employee satisfaction.
