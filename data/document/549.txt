Automate the process of attaching the logs to the SR sent via email
Logs get lost when ownership of SR changes.
Makes our job tough. Asking for repetead logs frustrates customer.
One of the reasons affecting CSAT.
The idea of automatically updating the SR is not new.
But automatically attaching the logs could be new.
We face this in our everyday work.
One apporach to this would be to integrate the email with service center.
This is not new and we have seen this in other organisations.

We should be able to send emails from with in Service Center and when the customer sends an email it should update the SR automatically.
Save time in asking logs again and again.
