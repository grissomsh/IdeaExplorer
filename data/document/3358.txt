 EMC UCP – Unified Communication Platform leveraging Microsoft Lync2013

 The idea came up while working in collaboration with other TSEs in which we need a unified reference to employees, customers’ contact information ..etc. we then discussed the needs and possible improvement in a brainstorming session.
 The idea works as follows :

-	Unified conferencing feature for internal employees and customers (no more webex)
-	Customers Address book will be added to the existing employees address book feature of outlook.
-	Integration with “Inside EMC” employees profiles to provide a unified place for : call, email, message or meeting with any employee. Each function has its own button and that’s it.
-	Quick FTP feature allowing seamless file sharing 
-	Create connections of employees I interact with the most for ease of communication in future.

The UCP will include these features on top of Microsoft Lync:

-	“Draw it Dashboard” feature for better collaboration as described in this Idea Link I proposed : https://innovationcentral.corp.emc.com/#menu_view_ideas?id=2014005245 
-       ability to send voice recorded messages.
-	Run a conference call instantly with few clicks.
