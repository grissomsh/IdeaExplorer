Global Village
promotes diversity and exposure to different cultures, ways of thinking and helps innovate. 
I have been exposed to similar events in AIESEC at university and it has been very beneficial to get exposed to different cultures, taste their food, learn about their history and get over any stereotype. 
create a global village event where every employee/group of employees would showcase a different background, culture, interest or hobbies. This can address any stereotypes as well by presenting a different point of view than what people expect. There should be challenges throughout the day where people have to collaborate with each other and come up with ideas and benefit from their diversity to have a winner at the end. 
the success of this idea would be that employees get to know each other, benefit from their diversity and come up with new ideas.
