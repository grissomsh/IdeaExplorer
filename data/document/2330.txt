Removal of paper cups from Pantry
strongly recommend to stop using the paper cups in all the pantries and start of using Ceramic or plastic cups for drinking water and hot beverages. This will reduce the cost to company and helps to keep the health of employees.

 
I have read the articles in Times of India on how the paper cups cause cancer.
Use plastic cups for drinking water and ceramic cups for hot beverages. You may have spend initially with some cost to buy cups and later for cleaning of cups when employees use. This far more better than spending on Paper cups and screwing employees health. 
It will save money, improve employees health
