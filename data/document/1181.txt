Efficient Hospital Equipment Management - using Smart Sensors and IoT
Egypt COE Smart City and IoT Challenge: This idea helps into better health-care & hospital management using IoT and Sensors.

With inception of IoT, integrated management of equipment, resources can be done in any field. This idea just came up, while I was thinking about applications of IoT in different possible fields.

I propose the following solutions to this problem:

1. Install Display and tracking sensors on each medical equipment & Beds.
2. Track each Medical Equipment and hospitals BedS using RFID and store information such as - Dept, Equipment Type, Location, and Status.
3. Connect each of the equipment and bed using Integrated Hospital Equipment Tracking & Management System.
4. Monitor, manage and direct equipment & Bed  usage from Centralized Management System.
5. Do Load-balancing of the equipment usage based on patient inflow

The idea has got multiple benefits, few of that I have listed below:

1. Better Management & Trace-ability of Hospital Equipment and Beds
2. Optimal / maximum resource utilization within a Hospital.
3. Reduce Capital Expenses on Equipment and Beds.
4. Use Big Data,  data-analytic to analyse the usage pattern  and proactively plan the new equipment and bed based on that.
