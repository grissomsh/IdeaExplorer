A Smarter Egypt 
to reinvent data storage, archiving, backup and recovery, networking and Data Analytic to better handle a Smart City with millions of internet-connected sensors geographically distributed across different locations across the city.
the idea came to me as I used to be a cloud computing specialist, and I am well aware that cloud computing is not exploited properly in our region (especially in Egypt). Therefore the idea crystallized that since Egypt is currently in the process of investing in it's infrastructure, this would be the time to ensure a futuristic approach and start by integrating IOT devices and connect them to the cloud. 
once we get this solution to the cloud, we will be able to effectively manage data storage, archiving, backup and recovery, networking and Data Analytics of our collected data (in this case we're offloading all infrastructure related aspects to the cloud provider; leaving more time for us to work on how to make our solution more efficient and focus on getting better insights out of it; not to mention leverage the speed of deployment benefit we get from using the cloud). 
Success here would take many forms, starting from the government and the insights they would get on traffic, crimes, and economic stability, and even touristic insights, would steer the government on where to start when developing ideas to better the coun
