Virtual Science Lab (VSL)

We came up with the idea after seeing the initiative to provide virtual bio chemistry labs, neurological labs by Amrita University India. When we can do a complex biological experiments virtually we still have space to create virtual labs for all in IT industry.

Virtual applications in Life Sciences and bioinformatics education stems from the capabilities they offer to create a cyberspace where users can interact with other participants (through their avatars) or objects, creating new experiences that are not often feasible in the real world.

Create Virtual world to offer real-time communication tools, interaction capabilities and collaboration empowerment tools to the users for group-work and team building, share events and presentations and constructive activities using Pivotal, VmWare, Greenplum and Big-Data/Hadoop.

Using emerging new and user-friendly software, Data-Scientist and trainers could design and develop interactive model resources by themselves.

OpenSim is one of the tools that can be referred.
