Better Bengaluru through  technology

I came up with these idea on a  Sunday Afternoon on 9th November while watching a television show on how mobile phone are harming human body and then had a discussion with my Dad on how we can or how we should solve it . 
My Idea is to install sensor device's which senses radio waves in office spaces . These devices should have the flexibility to be set at various levels with 1 being minimum radio waves and say 10 being  maximum radio waves. These devices once installed in office spaces , should send an alarming signals when higher radio waves are detected.

These works like a Fire alarm installed in office space and can control exposure to radio waves , which very slowly damages our body.

We cannot avoid these devices as we are addicted to them , but we can avoid excessive exposure of radio waves emitted by these devices by sending alarming signal so that 
1.) one can get away from those areas which might have limited connectivity or where signal strength is weak.
2.) start using Headsets , instead of talking in phone directly or via bluetooth.
