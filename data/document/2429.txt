Book Club.
I am submitting my idea in HR challenge. As this idea will highlight the talents we have in EMC, ensure the gender and ethnic diversity and bring to employees a place to discuss different cultures, stories, ideas and inspirations.


I have joined book clubs before and I loved the times where we could sit, talk about a certain book and be exposed to people's brilliant perceptions, ideas and reflections upon the same book. It was an eye opener and highly beneficial.

When I joined EMC, I found there was no book club created. I found several colleagues who read while coming and going to work. Colleagues who set to go to the book fair together, and this is when I wanted to start a book club in Egypt COE.

A survey has been already sent to colleagues, and I found lots of people who would be truly interested in having a book club. The survey included questions like their favorite authors, their favorite categories to read, also if they would be interested to have a monthly meeting where we can watch a documentary and discuss it together. 

We're still analyzing the surveys, yet the results are highly motivating.
What if we create a book club inside the premises as a first phase!
- We can discuss on a monthly basis a book of our choice. This book can be under any category, from business, management, self-help books to novels.
- We can also have a physical library where we can exchange books. We can set a borrowing book period of 3 weeks. This way, we can share the books we read, our passion for reading, and grow the influence we had out of our readings to spread on all people around us. 

As a second phase, we can also have an online portal where:
- We can have a soft copy of books, while maintaining all copyrights. This is to be implemented globally on EMC and will serve to make employees, across all EMC worldwide, reach each other, share their passion for reading, share their culture, different perspectives and perceptions even of the same book, share new ideas and form one big global community of EMC employees.
- These books can be not only sharing passion for reading but also an addition and help to any EMCian's career as they will include all categories from business, management, self-development and all needed topics that can be discussed, implemented and customized according to EMCians need, in our global book discussion.
- We can also add a book review of the book of our choice after our global discussion of it or general book reviews on the provided e-books on the portal.
- Moreover, we can initiate activities like short story writing, poetry writing and acts for famous plays. And this can go viral if we make a global competition where different winners from each COE compete globally and can eventually be awarded for EMC's best short story writer, poetry writer or actor.


If the first phase of the book club gets created, it will allow to form a unique community of readers within EMC, where sharing their passion definitely makes EMC a happier place to work in. This will reflect positively on employees work and will make every reader more attached to his/her workplace.

If the second phase gets created, we can have an influential community of readers globally across EMC, and a global competition of short story, poetry writing and acting can be performed.
