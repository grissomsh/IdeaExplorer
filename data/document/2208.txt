DragoNet
DragoNet is a project in which WiFi offloading occurs.
its a solution for better communication networks.

that idea was my graduation project idea , it came to my mind when i was in New York in 2012 where i found AT&T network in public and it was only authorized for AT&T users.
the idea was implemented theoretically on a small scale on Alexandria - Cairo railway road in which the user will pay extra fee + the ticket to use the Internet service . 
A solution for that is transferring all the mobile data usage over WiFi network to reserve the bandwidth available for phone calls.
Through high power antennas , transmitting WiFi signal , people connect to that wifi in the city automatically without permission , all the mobile data is on the wifi network, reserving all the bandwidth for the main function of the bandwidth which is phone calls.
Voip calls may then be added to the application to save money paid for the phone calls.
the service provider will benefit from the fees paid by the users (the user will pay less than he/she pay for the mobile data service) , more customer satisfaction (save money, no calls interruption, high mobile data rate through high power WiFi network)
