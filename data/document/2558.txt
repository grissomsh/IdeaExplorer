Quick lookup tool for Product Release notes.
EMC product software is updated frequently and subsequently new Release Notes are published. 
Downloading individual "Release notes" and manually checking "known issues" and "Fixed issues" is laborious and time consuming.
We need a central repository for all Product release notes.(VPLEX,VNX,BROCADE,SYMM,SOLUTIONS ENABLER etc). A Tool should index the Release notes and allow for key word searches. This will allow Customers, Field Engineers and TSEs to quickly search all release notes, for a specific product, and identify if the problem is a "known issue" and if/when the problem was "fixed".
A smarter way to review "known issues" and "fixed issues"  will improve troubleshooting efforts and speed time to resolution.
