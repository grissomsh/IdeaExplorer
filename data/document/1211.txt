IoT Secruity
IOT security design should enable an open, pervasive, interoperable yet secure infrastructure. So the IOT or smart objects must be capable of implementing  user set policies. 
Idea came when I was checking a home automation solution, and I started thinking of the Secutity for all the device access 
the idea is giving devices a token to use for the API calls. this could work for both device to cloud and cloud to app communication 
Provide a more secured communication between the devices and the app
