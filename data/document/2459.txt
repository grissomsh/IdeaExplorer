EMC Federation Collaboration excellence Joker!
The idea is relevant to the challenge in delivering better communication across the federation, hence provide customers better experience and cope with the new 3rd platform needs and demands.
No history to mention for the idea
My idea is to focus on people not tools! by creating a Joker (talntet team).. the idea is to create a team focused in all of the technologies, have needed trainings on all federation products and create a team of jokers, they must be talented and willing to learn with very high communication and innovation skills
Joker (talented) team will be able to:

- Communicate across the federation clearly, as well as communicate with customers
- Be able to help the sales team, hence increase our revenue
- Understands the challenges in the federation integration from technic
