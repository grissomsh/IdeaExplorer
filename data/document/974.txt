SLA breach avoidance measures
It will help in avoiding SLA breach 
When we had many breaches, Went throught ITAM carefully and came up with this idea
When incident comes in ITAM(remedy)we dont get any notification. But with certain permutations and combinations of reports and mails in ITAM. We can receive report or mail when new incident occurs
We will ensure SLA will not be breached as we get notification
We can also have a count on number of incidents received per day.
