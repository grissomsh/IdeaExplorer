Smart devices connected by smart phones.
According to IDC, the market size of smart devices will be $30 billion to $50 billion. It is a huge market. EMC can be a perfect player in this market as we will state below.
The market of smart devices have always been the one we are interested. Based on our previous PoC, we can quickly develop and deploy new apps to connect to smart devices.
-- Smart devices and app communicate with each other based on the mechanism of "subscribe/push". In this way, app and device can bind with each other. Push Notification is the key feature of Pivotal Cloud Foundry mobile services. We can leverage this feature to implement the communication binding/communiation between smart devices and app.
-- Security and scalability of IOT remains a challenge. In our solution, we will leverage enterprise-level security and scalability provided by Cloud Foundry to ensure the highest security and scalability of IOT.
-- Countless data will be generated by the thousands of thousands of smart devices in every minute. We will use big data analysis provided by the Pivotal Cloud Foundry to mine valuable information from the data.  
According to IDC, the market size of smart devices will be $30 billion to $50 billion. It is a huge market. On the other hand, EMC is seeking way towards big data transformation. Smart devices are important entry for big data. It is ofcource ieal place where EMC can show our capacity.
