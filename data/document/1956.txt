Hybrid Replication at VNX arrays
Software solution for VNX / VNXe arrays. 
I worked for EOS and we used VNX replication to have build areas at all development sites. Replication of 4Tb file system to my site took 1 month. And it took 1 month when master replica have to rollback to monthly snapshot. 

Having the ability to rollback snapshots at all sites simultaneously to the new replication point would take minutes for recovery instead of weeks.
Extend VNX replication protocol with feature that keeps file system snapshots with the same timestamp at all sites simultaneously; and rollback snapshot at all sites simultaneously. Both actions do not involve replication of data - only snapshot meta-information is transfered. Replication continues when rollback is completed. 

Snapshot creation and rollback should be managed from master site. VNX replication is continued from the recovery point.

It would allow our customer to improve RTO at VNX arrays w/o RecoverPoint.
