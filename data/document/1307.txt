ASC Process Automation Project

E2E Challenge:
Currently the ASC (Account Service Controller) process involves manual procedures that are time-consuming  with high average handling time and causes delay in performing ASC cases. 
Our aim is to plan and implement an enhanced process to reduce average handling time and hence reducing the case closing time..
This idea was already implemented in my previous team, & I carried the flag in our new team.
Develop Java Scripts that would Automate our processes, thus reducing man-hours & errors. The idea was implemented in the startup of our team and received the Yellow Belt as per LSS measures.
So far 20 Java Scripts were developed, which enhanced and simplified the ASC process. This project has increased efficiency of our team by:
-Saving time of 3.69 working days per 10 accounts' cleanups.
-Reducing 132.75 Man-hours by the use of automation.
-Reducing the errors in the outputs from 19.03% to zero%.
