Hardware recycle for Converged Infrastructure test and Data Server
1. CI Scale Out and Self Remediation
2. HW abstractions that provide common platform services
3. Mining of HW faults and alerts to predict part replacements
1. Find many idle materials including SP, SLICs, DAEs, Drives in the lab.
2. Those materials are hard to maintain
3. CI system need many servers to do testing.
4. Research CI system and Openstack to evaluate the idea to see if feasible.
1. Collect idle and working materials in lab to build the hardware resources pool
2. Setup CI hardware environment to connect server, controller, storage devices etc per ethernet network.
3. build CI software environment to provide management service.
4. Setup Openstack over CI and provide compute and storage services to global per RESTful interface
5. Build a background service on the system to predict bad hardware components and then back up and migrate the data to keep the data consistency.


1. Save cost for CI & data server material purchase
2. Provide large-scale infrastructure for CI testing
3. Reduce the efforts to maintain the idle materials and avoid wasting of material scrap
4. Avoid data missing and inconsistency
