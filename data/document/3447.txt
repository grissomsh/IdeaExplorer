Promotion and Adoption of Sustineo

I did not know about Sustineo until I saw this challenge on the Innovator's Roadmap. That seems to be the key problem - lack of awareness. I spoke to a few colleagues who also had not heard of Sustineo.  I then searched my inbox and found two emails that had mentioned Sustineo in the passing and I did not pick up on it.  The methods proposed will put Sustineo front and center.
I have utilized the proposed adoption methods for various intiatives and am confident they can work to promote awareness around Sustineo.
This works by creating awareness about Sustineo and promoting its benefits to all EMC employees through various adoption methods.  The general idea is to get the word out to ALL employees about Sustineo and what its key benefits are. Some of these include auto signatures in our emails, leveraging various newsletters, featuring Sustineo on the banner on Inside EMC etc.  
The methods work at the top down level and at the local level.  They involve everyone in EMC and if implemented correctly, over the period of a few months, the awareness of Sustineo will increase.
