CE call back timeframe

customers' satisfaction is one of EMC's values and this is one of the major issues customers face
setting time frame (24 hours) for CEs to get back to the customers if they call for help 
customers will be notified that they should expect a call within 24 hours
if a customer needs immediate help and doesn't want to wait, we can let the CE call back within a couple of hours
