Local Innovation Road map  

- Idea came up because some employees wants to submit any idea during the idea and get help in order to enhance it before the time of the Global Challenge.

- Also, Some employees are under pressure now to catch the time in order to submit ideas so we need to get ready before launching the ideas in the Global Challenge 
- Create Innovation Team per EMC Location.

- Create Local Program (Web-Based) to be accessible by EMC Employees.

- Innovation will announce on Challenges as well.

- Employees will submit a lot of ideas to this program and will be visible by local Judgement Team.

- Innovation Team will make a meeting with each one submitted good idea to get the way to enhance this idea in order to be ready for the bis challenge ( Global Innovation Road map)

- Also, That will increase the ideas as this system can be opened during the whole year in order to give the enough time to introduce very innovative ideas.
