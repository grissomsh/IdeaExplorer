Sabbatical focused on Bio Diversity
Unconscious bias exists in all of us. By increasing our exposure to diverse people and cultures, we open our minds to new perspectives. These perspectives can be catalysts to innovation.
This idea was the product of a PSRC (Kristen, Pascale, Tania Ward, Piyal Biswas,and Nazira Carlage) brainstorming session.
Offer employees the opportunity to take a 4 week sabbatical after 5 years of service.  Employees who take advantage of the opportunity, must dedicate a portion of that time to increasing their bio diversity. Some examples would be; mentor people with vastly different economic and social means and/or ethnicity, travel abroad, support a community initiative OUTSIDE of your own community... 
This solution will increase productivity and spark innovation.  Employees will return from their sabbaticals refreshed with "new eyes" to lay upon existing and new problems.
