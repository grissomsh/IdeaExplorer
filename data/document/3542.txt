 RDA – Replication Distributer and Accelerator – a solution for real time replication of huge files by graphics applications

 We have been comparing performance of distributed systems to centralized systems from the latency point of view.  We thought about introducing the approach of parallel replication 


 The idea works as follows :

-	The workstation produces huge amount of data that needs to be replicated to another destination 
-	The data is divided into parts/chuncks  and distributed to different filesystems on EMC storage locally (isilon or VNX)
-	EMC storage creates many concurrent replication sessions to the destination. Each sessions will copy a part of the data 
-	Metadata is sent along for construction of the big file at the destination again
