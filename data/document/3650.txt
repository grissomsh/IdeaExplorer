Carbon-Negative Plastic

Art from Atlas Packaging brought AirCarbon to the attention of the packaging team. We have received a sample and it is currently in the Materials Science Lab with Michael Sosnowski for testing.
NewLight produces AirCarbon, a certified carbon-negative plastic produced from methane captured from landfill emissions. AirCarbon can be made into both a film and a hard plastic. Two already identified potential areas of use are in begs and in RSA token shells, with the opportunity to expand into other plastic applications later. According to NewLight, AirCarbon is also less expensive than traditional plastics making the deployment of AirCarbon plastics a potential cost savings initiative also. 

For industry history - Dell announced the use of AirCarbon bags for Latitude laptop sleeve packaging in March 2014. In May 2014, Sprint announced it would be making cell phone cases from AirCarbon.
