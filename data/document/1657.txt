DPA as a VPLEX witness
- Durham Data Center Elastic Labs Challenge.
This innovation will reduce manual work done in R&D labs today, create opportunities for sharing equipment and reduce the amount of hardware needed and reduce the amount of traffic in the network. 

- Engineering Operations Services & Solutions (EOS2) Challenge.
This will improve customer experience and improve product quality and capabilities.

- Israel COE Challenge.
We are creating a better offer, leveraging DPA and VPLEX technologies.
We saw that customers complain about a need for a additional cluster VM, and thought how could we eliminate this requirement.
We thought about it several weeks ago.
The VPLEX Witness is a virtual machine that is deployed on a customer-provided ESX server. The VPLEX Witness has IP-based connectivity with both Metro-Plex clusters, and it maintains knowledge about each VPLEX cluster's view of inter-cluster connectivity. 
By reconciling its own observations with the information reported by the clusters, the VPLEX Witness can arbitrate between inter-cluster network partition failures and cluster failures, should they occur.
Many customers that have VPLEX might also have DPA installation. We suggest using the DPA as a witness. DPA monitors and analyses the data protection environment. DPA has strong monitoring capabilities for VPLEX, and hence already possesses most of the required information to act as a witness.
This change will allow the customer more flexibility, wonâ€™t require additional resources for the VM and encourage using DPA.
Another benefit of this solution is a built-in redundancy, as the DPA usually deployed as a cluster, i.e. more than one instance.

It will improve customer satisfaction.
It will enhance productivity and optimize a process, since the deployment process will take less time.
It will save money, since a VPLEX Metro deployment needs less resources.
