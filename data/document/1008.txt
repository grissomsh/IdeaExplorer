A Cloud Based Information Integration in Health Care Services Using Federated Data Lake
One of the biggest challenges in Healthcare applications is the streaming the data, which needs to be processed and integrated in real time. Follow-up data analysis would normally involve moving the collected data in Data Lake to a Cloud for knowing the status and record tracking purpose.
Looking at the opportunity and health care industry where globally evolving EMC federated solutions. Its came through coffee table and couple of brainstorming sessions had with following folks who are SME on emerging technology and aspiring to be DS (Diwahar) and Cloud and Storage Lead (Srivathsan) and Data Protection Lead (Harsha) Global accounts and delivery head (NAC) and also Sr. Solution Advisory Architect (Ashish Gulati) - this solutions came up with high degree of passion using everyone expertize with EMC federated technologies.   
The proposed architecture is designed to serve patient and doctors for self-caring helps, analyzing the diseases with similar historical medical records. Searching similar medical records from the massive and ever-increasing amount of medical records requires on-demand data storage model and elastic scalability to manage the rush hour access to the health care diagnosis service. Due to the salient characteristics of cloud computing such as on-demand storage & services, and elastic computing ability, a cloud-based framework is proposed in this system to implement the Information Integration Health Care Service.
