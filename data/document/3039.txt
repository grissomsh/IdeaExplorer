Use other cloud object storage in our cloud product
NA
My manager Kevin Cai has this idea called distributed mozy which will use AWS S3 API as data path and store object in S3 compatible cloud.
I extended this idea to general case.
Mozy is EMC product which provide cloud storage to our customer.
It use hard disks as local data store.
Why not use other cloud storage to replace hard disks?
We might save a lot if cloud storage is better than hard disks.
success: cheap storage, make profit from service rather than hardware
benefit to EMC: more income, less cost
