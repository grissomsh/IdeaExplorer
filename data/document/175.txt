"EMC Service Requests Create"
This is a process improvement idea 
This is the output of combined thoughts aiming to improve customer SR creation process
The idea is to have a tool that simplifies the customer process of creating SRS.

The tool can have a home view where the customer specifies the request type (upgrade, breakfix, hardware replacement,...), servers serial numbers and request details.

After the customer submits the request, it auto creates service requests and moves him/her to a reference view of all SR numbers that are linked together and can be accessed through each other.

These SRs will be auto routed to the relevant queues based on the information entered by the customer.
This idea will save time and increase efficiency of SR information
