Setup xCAT-Robot Framework HW automated testing framework to enhance HW mass production testing process
There are tools developeed to deploy, manage and orchestrate HW elements in cluster solutions.
I participated in deployment of such HW test framework for HPC production company for both RnD testing (both HW+middleware and middleware) and mass production quality control.
I suggest to use xCAT based infrastructure for managing mass production quality control, RobotFramework-based RFWeb framework to create, launch, manage and analyze tests and Jenkins CI to orchestrate all test tasks. Sucj infrustructure I setup for my previous project in other company. All tools are open sourced and easy to use. This set of tools let to prepare different OS images for different needs, change middleware if needed and so on. 
Such framework let my team to achive high performance for mass production qulity control. It looks like central web page where test engineer can submit new test configuration and when new device under test with given configuration will be connected to test network server sends OS image via PXE to it with some configuration (including upgrading middleware) and launch predefined set of functional and non-functional (performance and realibility for example) of tests. After test completion test engineers can verify test results on the web server (RED for server failed tests and GREEN for passed ones). All statictics can be stored and analyzed laterly (all inventry info also stored for following warranty usage for example).

Also such framwork have been used for mainboard initial fab testing including initial middleware burtin procedures.
