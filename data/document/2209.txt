Street Bumps Detector – towards less accidents in a Smart City  
Smart City cannot tolerate high accidents rate without utilizing the top notch technologies to address such issue. 
 We thought about an issue we face every day that we don’t wish to see any more in any smart city
 The solution is as simple as alerting drivers about street bumps while they drive allowing them enough time to take the correct action. The solution has two main components:

1-	Street Bumps Map:  Updating a database with each bump giving it an ID using its coordinate locations on the map. For each new street bump installed in the street (unexpected street bump), a new entry will be added (database update)
2-	GPS device inside the car can check its location against the nearest street bumps and whenever it is approaching a bump, it will notify the driver proactively to take the right action

EMC business will be in managing the central database and scaling it to the city level

1-	Less accidents rates – save lives
2-	Business for EMC
