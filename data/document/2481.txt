EMC Diversity Visa program
My idea will promote equality and diversity and help EMC build a more diverse workplace.
Since I joined EMC, I was fascinated by the way EMC focuses on Diversity and inclusion.
The EMC Diversity Visa is an annual program aiming to attract people from different religions, races/ethnic groups and gender all working together for a common cause that benefits the community: i.e. world hunger, education development, discrimination against elderly, womenâ€¦ etc.

EMC releases an annual challenge/assignment that should be opened to people from outside EMC regardless their sex, race, age, religious and political beliefs. Selected Applicants will have to work all together to achieve the common goal set by EMC. During the assignment, the team members will be evaluated and ranked based on their performance and achievements throughout the assignment duration. Top one will be offered a suitable job with EMC.
