Buddy up to Autism
EMC wants to have a diverse workforce and be a great place to work- I am proposing a way into hiring and retaining a diverse workforce with unique abilities.
Being the mother of a child diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder, I can see for myself what people with ASD can offer and how difficult it can be for them to regulate their social interactions. 
I would like to be a mentor to an ASD employee, yet when I looked in the Cork COE I could not find anybody who can tell me how and whom to help. 

There is a clear lack here and an opportunity for EMC to be innovative in its support of employees with special needs, while attracting unique talents.


People who are diagnosed on the autism spectrum disorder may have abilities that are very relevant to EMC- they may have a passion for a core subject and be specialist in that area, they have a exceptional eye for detail, recognise patterns and series... but they  lack in social skills and have difficulties to interact with others.

I would love to see in EMC a focus on recruiting people with ASD, and to see them accompanied/buddied with another EMC employee who will act as an advocate for them, and mentor them. They would act as a person of trust who could explain the subtleties of office life and co worker interaction. The mentor will also work with the ASD manager to explain what can be done to work along the ASD employee.
EMC could also facilitate offices where sensory overload can be minimised (light and sound levels adjustable, color on the walls).
If my idea was implemented, there would be a group of employees who would buddy up with other employees who are on the autism spectrum and would meet face to face or be available through IM/phone to discuss immediate issues with social interaction.
