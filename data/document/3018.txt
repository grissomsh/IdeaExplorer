EMC Positional Analytics Platform (EPAP)
This new EMC ECD software offering will enable the collection and analytics of real-time positional tracking data providing EMC customers additional and new insight on the movement of things such as retail shopping behavior, player tracking, and motion st
This idea came about when considering how to accurately track soccer player movements for later positional analysis and review with the team in order to better their play as a team. I have already done the background research and targeted an initial market entry point as well as other market segments where the EPAP system would be useful - not only as an on-premises system but as an hosted service oriented offering as well.
The EPAP system will provide a platform that currently does not exist with the capabilities envisioned. There are other limited data collection systems available but not one with the flexibility to rapidly build end user applications and utilize the rapidly expanding Internet of Things (IoT); Mobile phones, Personal Beacons, passive/active tag technologies etc. The system will be extensible allowing for the rapid integration of existing and new position tracking technologies.
A successful EPAP implementation would be a customer adopted software/hardware system that provides insight allowing EMC customers to increase their market specific sales and/or service to their customers. The system design would allow for the flexibility
