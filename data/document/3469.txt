Security SCREEN for Trusted Identities

I have been working with the developers of the GINA technology for a while and they have developed some unique capabilities around security.   This team has been working with security software technologies such as Mandiant, Palo Alto Networks, NetFuel and of course RSA.   
Connections into the data sources are done using existing or customized content servers available in the GINA environment.  A DHCP X-Type is used to organize and normalize the data from the various sources, thus creating the Vector Object stream.  The type or number does not limit connections.  An executable model and service that builds a constant stream captures the “lease and release” of all dynamically allocated IP addresses. With SCREEN, we have the flexibility in the models to take advantage of any data available from individual sources.  For instance, if the MAC Address is available at the DHCP source, we can incorporate it into the stream.  Finally, SCREEN provides the versatility for analysts to create customized forms, queries, alerts, or even initiate scripts to support security operations in relaxed-realtime.  A unique aspect of this technology is the ability to integrate and interoperate with existing RSA products.  This technology can enhance any and all security software systems with no coding and simply GINA environment configuration.  Lastly, another key benefit is that GINA runs as a group of Virtual Machines in an VCE or VSPEX environment.
