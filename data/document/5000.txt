Socialized content sharing and interchanging by connecting people

socialized application is critical to improve productivity and reduce communication overhead
The key component of the platform is activity stream just like twitter streams. It display the activities of people/group you followed.
In enterprise, the group concept can be reinforced that people can follow group and each member in these group. 
So user can be notified by each activities/news that want. That is connecting people via socialized manner.

The other component is actually content itself - homepages,wikis, blogs, forums, todo list etc. Each changes on these content will be dispatched to activity streams for followers.

A typical use case is between support engineer and engineering team. The support engineers can be notified by each document/product updates immediately by following engineering groups.For engineering team, the publishing work is quite simply - just publish a message to homepage, followers will be notified.
