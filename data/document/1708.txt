Create a help line dedicated for information about diversity and inclusion all over EMC
Understanding the diversity of ethnic and cultural backgrounds is essential to the way the people in EMC to work together every day, so we should provide various ideas like training programs to help all the employees build a better future.
I thought about the idea while thinking about how I can get information about helping people with disabilities or how can get the right information about it.
In my idea I'm thinking about creating a dedicated help line that any employee can call—anonymously and at no charge—for information and advice on disability-related topics. having such help line will encourage the employees to gain information needed to understand and react based on facts and will encourage them to be more open and understanding of what we should do to make our company a great place to work.
One of the major goals of EMC that they want people of all abilities to thrive, and we can't thrive without a secured source of information with right and in time answers.
